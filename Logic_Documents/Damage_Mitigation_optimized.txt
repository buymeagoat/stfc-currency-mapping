Damage mitigation has 3 components: armor, shield deflection, and dodge.
For each component:
1. Divide the corresponding defense value by the corresponding piercing value.
2. Look up the mitigation in the provided chart.
3. Weight each individual mitigation value based on ship type:
   - Surveys: 0.3
   - Battleships: 0.55 (armor), 0.2 (shield deflection, dodge)
   - Explorers: 0.2 (armor, dodge), 0.55 (shield deflection)
   - Interceptors: 0.2 (armor, shield deflection), 0.55 (dodge)
4. Compute final mitigation using the function:

   Mitigation = 1 - (1 - cA * f(dA / pA)) * (1 - cS * f(dS / pS)) * (1 - cD * f(dD / pD))

   where:
   - dA, dS, dD are defender's armor, shield deflection, and dodge.
   - pA, pS, pD are attacker's armor piercing, shield piercing, and accuracy.
   - cA, cS, cD are weighting coefficients based on ship type.

5. The function f follows a logistic curve:

   f(x) = 1 / (1 + 4^(1.1 - x))

This formula provides an accurate approximation (0.1% error margin) for damage mitigation calculations.

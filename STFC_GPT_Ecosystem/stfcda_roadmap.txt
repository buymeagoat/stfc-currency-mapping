STFC Ecosystem Roadmap Document – Draft
Purpose:
This document outlines planned enhancements and long-term development goals for the STFC GPT Ecosystem. It serves as a living reference to ensure GPT development aligns with system needs and user priorities.

Current Focus (Active Development – Incorporated in v2.2)
Cooldown Time Integration:

Evaluate cooldowns for refinery pulls, faction store claims, daily tasks, and other economic actions.
Optimize player resource flow based on cooldown cycles.
Full Economy Evaluation Scope Expansion:

Incorporate the following systems into economic evaluations:
Refinery: Isogen, Ore, Gas, Crystal, Armada Directives.
Faction Stores: Credits, Ship Parts, Officer Tokens.
Daily Claims: Parsteel, Tritanium, Dilithium.
Away Teams: Assignment frequency, critical success rates.
Syndicate: XP, resource claims.
Independent Archives: Territory and Exchange resource claims.
Events: Milestone and leaderboard rewards.
Planned Features (Near-Term Roadmap – Post v2.2)
Resource Harvesting Play Style Profiles:

Basic: Single pulls only.
Advanced: Cost-effective, balanced approach (lowest/medium pulls).
Expert: Maximum pulls for efficiency.
Goal: Users select a profile for quick configuration of resource gathering strategy.
Custom Pull Configuration (User-Defined Per-Resource Preferences):

Allow custom pull settings for each resource type.
Example: “2-chest pull for 2* Isogen, max pull for 3* Isogen.”
Goal: Fine-tune refinery and claim preferences to align with personal strategy.
Long-Term Vision
Efficiency Profile Overhaul (Resource Flow Integration):

Expand efficiency profiles to dynamically reflect harvesting strategies.
Integrate user-configured play styles (Basic, Advanced, Expert) or custom pull plans into profile calculations.
Memory Indexing (Historical Validation Pattern Recognition):

Retain past validation reports and player data for pattern detection.
Enable cross-referencing prior discrepancies and efficiency evaluations.
Automated Resource Flow Optimization (Ultimate Goal):

Given player research, efficiency profile, cooldowns, and play style:
Automate the generation of an optimal daily/weekly claim schedule.
Recommend adjustments based on formula changes, patch updates, or user progression.
Governance
This roadmap is maintained by User Architect and should be reviewed before each version update.
Roadmap adjustments require alignment with STFC System Design Document (v1.0) and approval from User Architect.
Versioning:
v1.0 – Initial Draft (February 2025)

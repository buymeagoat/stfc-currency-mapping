STFCKE Transcript Processing Protocol (TDP) – v1.1
Date: 2025-02-20
Version: 1.1

Overview
This document defines the mandatory multi-pass approach to transcript and video processing for STFCKE.
The goal is to maximize data capture density, ensure contextual insights are converted into structured knowledgebase entries, and improve long-term pattern detection across multiple sources.

This protocol is authoritative for all uploaded transcript and video files.
STFCKE must consult and apply this protocol during transcript processing in addition to the core extraction directives in v4.7.9.

Step 1: Surface Extraction (Initial Pass)
Perform the standard extraction of all three data types:

Quantitative Data (Mandatory): Costs, percentages, requirements, refinery outcomes, yields, upgrade paths, event earnings, sourcing methods, efficiency modifiers.
Expert Gameplay Guidance (Mandatory if Mentioned): Ship evaluations, officer performance, PvP crews, research efficiency, event strategies, sourcing recommendations.
Meta/Emergent Trends (Soft Data): Sourcing shifts, RNG volatility, bottlenecks, player frustrations, system trends.
Capture Requirements:
Record every explicit value, percentage, cost, RNG result, or upgrade detail.
Document all officer setups, crew combinations, or ship strategies when discussed.
When any sourcing method is mentioned (e.g., faction store, scrapping), capture the pathway details.
Event earnings and participation metrics (e.g., “I got 200k event points”) must always be recorded.
Step 2: Contextual Enrichment (Second Pass)
Evaluate surrounding context for implied data, performance cues, and efficiency markers.

Key Signals to Extract:
Context Cue	Extraction Requirement
Efficiency Gains	Statements like “filling cargo faster,” “grinding well,” or “saved time” → Capture as Expert Guidance with efficiency emphasis.
Performance Evaluation	Phrases like “this worked better than expected,” “my crew crushed it,” or “this officer didn’t work” → Capture as Expert Guidance even if values are absent.
Unlock/Progression Context	“This helped me unlock X” or “finally got my Pilum” → Extract as Meta Trend: Systemic Progression Indicator.
Frustration or Confusion	Complaints about event milestones, refinery payouts, PvP participation limits → Capture as Meta Trend: RNG Volatility, Bottleneck, or Systemic Frustration.
Step 3: Hidden Mechanic Signals
Capture incomplete, vague, or anecdotal references to underlying systems, as these often predate formal discovery.

Specific Watch Areas:
Mention	Extraction Requirement
Officer Interactions	“Synergy didn’t work,” “felt stronger,” “didn’t stack” → Extract as Expert Guidance (Officer Effect Uncertainty) with Uncertainty_Marker=Yes.
Combat Outcomes	“Weird damage,” “unexpected win/loss,” “hostiles behaving differently” → Capture as Meta Trend: Combat Mechanic Oddity.
Artifact/Prime Dependence	“Helped by artifact” or “Prime efficiency made it cheaper” → Link Artifact/Prime to upgrade cost or performance entry (even if values are missing).
Step 4: Partial Data Bridging
Infer and complete sourcing or efficiency pathways from fragmented mentions.

Partial Data Type	Bridging Requirement
Scrapping, Refinery, or Store Loop	If part of the sourcing loop is mentioned, e.g., “I scrapped a ship,” capture the partial pathway and flag it for future completion.
Cost vs. Efficiency Modifiers	When a raw cost is stated but efficiency research or primes are implied, record both as separate data points and annotate potential modifiers.
Event Earnings with Ops Context	“I scored 500k in this event” → Capture the value with Ops Level if mentioned, and annotate Event Name even if the player’s outcome is not generalized.
Step 5: Cross-Segment Reinforcement
Track repeat mentions across the transcript, even when the data seems repetitive. Each instance amplifies trend strength.

Repetition Area	Reinforcement Requirement
PvP Arena Concerns	Every “bracket issue,” “speed cap,” or “outmatched” mention → Capture each one individually as Meta Trend: Systemic PvP Arena Concern.
Event Struggles	“Missed the event” or “barely finished” → Capture as Meta Trend: Participation Bottleneck.
Fleet Milestones	“Just got my Pilum” or “Third Amalgam” → Record as Meta Trend: Fleet Progression Indicator, signaling resource accumulation patterns.
Data Classification Augmentation Requirements
When applying data classifications under the v4.7.9 structure, apply these specific augmentations when context requires:

Context	Additional Field Adjustment
Crew Performance by Ops Level	Add Performance Context Field (e.g., “Effective for Ops 50+ PvP,” or “Underperforms vs. Heavy Interceptors”).
Research and Prime Efficiency Overlap	Cross-link entries if Prime benefits are reduced by general research improvements (e.g., “G3 Prime losing value after Efficiency Research”).
PvP Strategy Divergence	When PvP crews differ based on Ops level (e.g., G4 vs. G5), create tiered data points, rather than aggregating into one general recommendation.
Review and Validation
Post-Extraction Validation Requirements:

Partial or Incomplete Data → Cross-check with User Architect for further inquiry if:
Partial sourcing loops or vague mechanic descriptions are flagged.
RNG volatility complaints cluster within 7 days across transcripts.
PvP participation bottlenecks are mentioned multiple times.
Uncertainty Handling (Refreshed Criteria)
Uncertainty_Marker=Yes must be applied if:

Yield data appears extreme or rare (e.g., “back-to-back 24k pulls”).
Performance evaluation lacks concrete stats (e.g., “felt better” vs. damage output).
Officer synergy or ability is claimed without evidence.
Versioning Record

0:11
fancy intro music yeah
0:15
woohoo last night in the dark of the
0:18
night the game did a big update and it's
0:20
going to hopefully give you some bug
0:21
fixes you've been looking for as well as
0:23
announcing a big slew of updates to PvP
0:26
Arenas which I did last night and as
0:28
many are also experienced
0:30
yeah maybe the lag is slightly better
0:32
the matches are still kind of rough I'm
0:34
very curious to see what your thoughts
0:35
are going to be with the proposed
0:36
changes and I got to have some good ones
0:38
you see here with this 57 I went back
0:41
and forth with which was quite Fun by
0:42
the way shout out to them they had some
0:44
really big ships like beefy I managed to
0:47
get some good ones in too don't worry I
0:50
got some good punches in but how does
0:52
that apply to everybody else what is
0:54
this going to look like and is it better
0:56
or is it worse well to determine that
0:58
let's start with the
1:00
themselves for the patch so this is
1:02
mostly just covering bug fixes we will
1:04
talk about the arena updates and what
1:06
that looks like here in a bit but let's
1:08
talk about the different changes coming
1:10
up starting with allons tournaments
1:11
they're fixing on things particularly
1:13
working on a lot of the UI issues that
1:15
the game has had which have caused a lot
1:17
of lag and a lot of annoyances for
1:19
various players so stuck on loading
1:21
screen and access Alliance level one
1:23
that one I don't really feel like it's
1:25
going to affect 99.99% of y'all but it's
1:28
in the list so there it is and then this
1:30
one though the timeout error was
1:32
definitely an issue that I'm sure a lot
1:33
of you experienced if you did feel free
1:35
to chime in but that should should be
1:38
fixed remember I'm not you know
1:40
verifying this I'm just giving you the
1:41
notes and talking about what they said
1:44
Alliance star bases surprisingly that's
1:47
important I think I guess sure that
1:49
happens we actually have a star base on
1:51
server 710 yep it exist okay fix an
1:56
issue with the build Li Starbase screen
1:58
displayed even after Starbase was
1:59
already con instructed I'll be honest I
2:01
don't look at that screen enough to know
2:03
incorrect Battle Log
2:05
exports I will tell you as someone who
2:07
works a lot with SPO club and other
2:09
tools I do really really like anything
2:12
that improves the exportable files let
2:14
me go and tell you those CSV files are
2:17
not perfect in fact not everything that
2:19
gets displayed in your game can be
2:21
correct so uh it's it's a headache if
2:24
you're ever curious talk to the SPO club
2:26
guys they do a lot of good work but
2:28
fixing some bugs and Arenas empty object
2:30
viewer HUD and ship management view
2:32
defect so as in when you're there and
2:34
like your whole ship
2:36
disappears yeah that was a bummer
2:39
supposedly that's fixed curtain
2:40
animations sticking and Arena rank icons
2:43
getting worked on artifacts power
2:45
display there was an issue that I
2:46
noticed and I'm sure many of you did a
2:48
lot of people brought it up to me where
2:50
you would have incorrect amounts uh for
2:53
the display power on them so that's
2:54
gotten adjusted the Kum time weapon and
2:57
the DTI device and the Lura now you'll
3:00
notice a couple of those are pay only
3:02
items but did get brought up then
3:05
missing Remnant bundles fix an issue or
3:07
some artifact Remnant bundles like the
3:08
pocket watch and the time weapon did not
3:10
appear in the refinery after your
3:11
requirements are met that is a good fix
3:14
for those of you out there who have the
3:15
rank and Etc to go after that all right
3:18
DTI and faction store chaos Tech bundle
3:20
where it is getting a little bit of a
3:22
boof in terms of fixing an error a
3:26
charge for the pocket watch and Crum
3:28
that is where the purchase one of heart
3:30
could give shards intended for the other
3:32
that obviously would be frustrating for
3:33
most people if you want something you
3:35
want that thing not some stupid RNG for
3:38
another thing and then we have the
3:39
untriggered building material bundles
3:41
and systems labels independent so these
3:43
are mostly like I said UI and node fixes
3:47
the real beef of this is in what they've
3:48
changed the Arenas but feels
3:50
disingenuous to not thank them for fixes
3:54
so here we are all right fix an issue
3:56
antich charge alignment anti- stack
3:57
alignment Nam were inconsistent in
3:58
different interfaces I'm
4:00
really I don't know about that one
4:03
honestly I feel like that was just
4:04
people needing to read better but anyway
4:06
refits and grade five ships low
4:08
resolution textures this one is
4:11
interesting because I've been talking
4:14
about that for years and when I say
4:16
years I mean years I'm not saying that
4:18
in like a exaggeration I mean years
4:21
we've been like hey when of those
4:23
textures going to be better when the
4:26
answer is supposedly now but not now how
4:29
do I know not
4:31
now because not now right right there
4:34
that's
4:37
hideous
4:39
yeah can't tell me that's fixed right
4:42
like I'm not trying to be that G scopely
4:44
but nope oh that's that's still ugly all
4:48
right inst repair and waves officer
4:49
Suitor short description cut off
4:51
resolved a UI problem what truncated his
4:53
ability so again same kind of things
4:55
that we looked at before and then more
4:57
HUD artifact Gallery pip EXO comp name
5:00
and missing art full icon on empty docks
5:04
all of these getting fixed and adjusted
5:06
there are a couple that have affected me
5:07
for example this away team one did
5:09
affect me and I do appreciate it getting
5:10
fixed which is not being able to collect
5:13
after we did uh speedups now let's go
5:16
over to the arena side of things this is
5:18
where a lot of Chang are being
5:19
introduced some big ones here in
5:22
particular we got a test coming for the
5:24
19th on the EU side but if that test
5:26
rolls out well you're going to see
5:28
public squads see Ops levels changing
5:31
and you all see this the 24th of
5:35
February so right around the corner this
5:37
upcoming Monday but be able to Squad
5:39
with commanders from any Alliance on
5:41
your server opening up new ways to play
5:43
Ops levels are being adjusted from plus
5:45
and- 7 to plus and minus 4 so almost
5:48
cutting it in half that means if you are
5:52
a level 56 like one of my accounts that
5:54
means the most I can invite in is a 52
5:57
and a 60 so that's a much closer range
6:02
which would limit what your opponent are
6:03
going to be now for higher levels who
6:04
are going to say hey this limits who I
6:06
can play with that is where the public
6:10
Squad comes in hopefully you can pair up
6:11
with more people in your server to allow
6:13
you to play for those of you who are
6:15
lower level this is hopefully going to
6:17
make matchmaking closer so that you are
6:19
able to play less higher levels like for
6:22
me I run into a lot of sigmas when I am
6:23
playing with other 56s this makes that
6:26
far less likely to happen now it could
6:29
still happen if I paired with a 60 and a
6:31
64 for example but again the ability to
6:34
manipulate Ops has been shrunk but at
6:36
the same time that is going to hopefully
6:39
benefit most players now one quick thing
6:43
and I want to know yall's thoughts do
6:44
you think these are good one negative
6:46
does not change the speed cap which I do
6:49
feel while well- intended has made this
6:52
an unplayable feature for so many
6:54
players and we've seen participation
6:57
rates drop significantly using FC
7:00
statistics we've looked and seen over
7:01
half the number that we're playing in
7:03
month one as in how many we're actively
7:05
doing it less than half we doing that
7:07
now so we'll see if it's enough to get
7:10
players back but I still think the speed
7:12
cap is a huge killer so our public
7:15
squads cross server there's a nice
7:17
little Q&A here with Liam that y'all can
7:18
read as we look over it no they are not
7:21
cross server public squads you're going
7:23
to have to join people from your server
7:24
on server 20 that' be IA epic feds Etc
7:28
joining together right why testing the
7:31
EU only first we want to confirm
7:33
performance and stability on a smaller
7:34
scale so they're going with one region
7:38
the EU doing the testing does the new
7:40
Ops level range apply to Alliance squads
7:42
yep it's plus four minus 4 for everybody
7:46
what if I'm in an alliance and face my
7:48
own Alliance mates in the arena everyone
7:50
is fair game which I will say I like
7:53
this
7:54
I'm get mad at me I don't know I
7:56
actually think this is nice I think it's
7:57
a nice change the ability to potentially
7:59
end up going against your own teammates
8:01
because they're opening up to public
8:03
squads that sounds really neat and I'm
8:05
actually looking forward to playing with
8:06
some of my friends and other
8:08
alliances and then maybe running into my
8:11
own guys that actually sounds really
8:13
neat I'm not going to lie it does I call
8:15
me whatever you want I think that sounds
8:17
neat sadly the speed cap is still in
8:20
effect public squads won't fix that
8:22
underlying issue but these updates help
8:24
us gather more data my personal hope is
8:26
that they lift it somewhat 275 is just
8:29
so below will the day of the week change
8:31
we have no immediate plans to move sadly
8:33
that's still the case yes I've been
8:35
bringing that up and I will continue to
8:36
say that most players want at least a
8:38
rotating schedule hopefully when they
8:40
get everything fixed maybe that happens
8:42
how are the teams colors names handle on
8:44
public squads the name is based on the
8:46
squad leaders Alliance allies appear
8:48
purple want appear blue they be from
8:51
your alliance or not and last but not
8:53
least is there any chat feature no still
8:56
no chat feature so with this in mind do
8:59
you all feel like these are steps in the
9:01
right direction do you feel like these
9:02
are actually better or do you feel like
9:04
this is more of the same right and I try
9:08
to always do op you know manipulation
9:11
that got me closer to guaranteeing I was
9:14
around like level players and sometimes
9:15
I'd face higher levels like this 59 and
9:18
60s from yesterday and sometimes I could
9:20
win sometimes I would lose actually
9:22
believe we lost this match by the way
9:24
shout out to um havoc and Company I'm
9:26
pretty sure we lost that one even though
9:28
I got some good wins in
9:29
uh definitely lost against Mis shout out
9:31
to Mis good cruise but hopefully the
9:35
plus4 minus four gives players more of
9:37
what they're hoping for which is you
9:38
know balanced matchmaking especially now
9:41
with a lot of the strategy being removed
9:43
with the speed cap so if you're going to
9:45
have that you absolutely need to limit
9:47
who you can end up being against as an
9:50
opponent but still there's a lot of
9:52
issues with Arenas we'll see what these
9:54
test runs look like I am curious your
9:55
thoughts this has been today's slot for
9:57
you but hopefully it's informative and
10:00
what you want to see live long in
10:01
plunder stay safe of the Space Cowboys
10:03
Deuces that's me catch you on the next
10:04
AR my video I'm out an even better outro
10:07
than the intro for the Empire and glory
10:10
to your house

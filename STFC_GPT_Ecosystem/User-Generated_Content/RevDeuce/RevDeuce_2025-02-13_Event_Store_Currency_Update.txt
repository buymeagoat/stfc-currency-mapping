[Music]
0:11
fancy intro music yeah
0:15
woohoo welcome back to Star Tre fle man
0:17
fans today's video I want to do a couple
0:19
things one I want to be informative and
0:21
talk to youall about where vent store
0:22
currency currently stands and two I
0:25
really want to ask for you to intercede
0:27
for your fellow players now that might a
0:30
little bit of weird cuz well that's my
0:32
job right well it is but with your help
0:34
hopefully we can actually get some
0:35
action taken the biggest issue that I
0:37
want to raise up is actually for our
0:39
lower level players out there in the
0:40
game and while yes G4 has become the
0:43
highest populated uh section of players
0:46
in the game still there's a lot of
0:49
players below D4 how many players you
0:52
might ask well from level 39 below there
0:54
over 130,000 active players in the game
0:57
right now that's in G2 and G3 and of
1:00
that about 10,000 are locked at level 39
1:03
or below as in they could not Ascend if
1:06
they wanted to that's important
1:07
information so keep that kind of like in
1:09
your back pocket when we get into what
1:11
we're going to discuss let's go over
1:14
where currency is right now so for you
1:16
players that are above level 40 Rejoice
1:18
because you've actually had a decent run
1:20
when I say decent I I mean decent Q snap
1:23
so here's where free-to-play players are
1:26
right now if you're above level 40 on
1:28
this side now I've edited this to also
1:31
include where players are below level 40
1:33
you can see in that top right corner up
1:35
there as well as the events that are in
1:37
bold those will apply to sub level 40
1:39
now number one you can see why I'm
1:41
raising this video here and asking for
1:43
players to join me in action because
1:46
well there's a lot less bold than there
1:47
is anything else and as far as what
1:49
players are earning let's talk about
1:51
that before we get into like the the
1:52
nitty-gritty of why I'm having a little
1:54
bit of a REV rant and a gripe so where
1:57
we're at now halfway we're at the 50%
1:59
mark of the event store for February
2:01
2025 and we're looking at around 200,000
2:04
event store currency for Pure freeto
2:07
playay that is doing nothing else that's
2:08
no ams's that's no heroics that's no
2:10
slbs albs none of that just pure points
2:14
from gifts battle pass SMS Etc so that
2:17
means that if we multiplied by two in
2:19
theory not giving yall that that is the
2:21
definite amount that's going to happen
2:22
that means level 40 and above
2:24
free-to-play players will should maybe
2:27
possibly end up with around 400,000 cury
2:30
earned why is this important why does
2:32
that number matter because to me that's
2:34
the magic number and when I say magic
2:36
number I refer to this sheet right here
2:38
here is what it was historically see we
2:41
we creeped up and you see we had a low
2:44
in the beginning of 318,000 but we
2:46
basically averaged ignoring the amazing
2:49
Christmas that was DS9 have averaged
2:51
around 400,000 for free to play until
2:55
here and then in 2024 the bottom fell
2:58
out and currency simply evaporated now
3:01
there are a couple of reasons we've
3:02
discussed as to why number one being
3:04
they started including materials in
3:06
those months as well as currency so the
3:08
value was the same remember how they
3:11
value things is very different than how
3:12
we value things now we saw at the end of
3:14
the year it start to increase we are
3:16
currently on Pace again on Pace to get
3:20
back to around that number better than
3:22
the past two events stores so that is
3:24
good again for our level 40 and above
3:27
players and we've seen a new event drop
3:29
today if you're watching video As the
3:31
day that it comes out with this Twisted
3:33
nature which is going to have a meta SMS
3:36
that is nice for you helping or helping
3:38
you to get suor shards but also a very
3:41
nice 36,000 of instore currency and we
3:43
do appreciate more being more and I'm
3:45
thankful this is available to lower
3:47
level accounts this being of course my
3:49
level 28 account over on server 710 as
3:53
I'm grinding through those events but
3:55
let's go over what is not 2.0 about this
3:59
process and you can tell that there is a
4:01
methodology to scopely and that's kind
4:02
of what I want to speak out against I've
4:05
said this before the way that scopely
4:07
wants players to play their game is not
4:10
how players play their game what do I
4:12
mean by that well let's just put it this
4:14
way it's no kinky dink that lower level
4:17
players don't have as many events that
4:19
pay out currency it's not a mistake it's
4:22
not a oops I forgot it's a this is how
4:25
it is and again I'm not trying to use
4:26
inflammatory language or be mean or
4:28
frustrated but we know what scop has
4:30
been saying for a very long time they
4:32
want players to level up and this brings
4:35
me back to those numbers that I pointed
4:36
to you just a little bit go and again if
4:38
you're ever curious about these numbers
4:40
and you want to know everything that I
4:42
do is open to the public so we use stfc
4:45
statistics we crack and track every
4:47
event every player and one of the new
4:49
things that we working on now is good
4:51
actually track player grow to see how
4:53
much people are actually progressing and
4:55
that panned out because of the meta
4:56
event that came out for the 28 days and
4:59
all the other stuff that they had for
5:00
that big domination event that we didn't
5:02
necessarily agree on but it did give us
5:04
hey we should probably start looking
5:05
into that because if scopely finds it
5:06
valuable and we should too so what do
5:09
these numbers tell us well the numbers
5:10
tell us as I told you that there are
5:12
over 130,000 active players below level
5:15
40 for those curious what the numbers
5:17
are for above level 40 well G4 players
5:20
there are currently about 68,000 so
5:23
close to being 69,000 G4 players about
5:26
29,000 G5 players and 11,000 G6 with
5:31
less than 600 level 70s in the entire
5:33
world so the game wants players to go up
5:38
to level 40 and above then you can tell
5:41
that the new content again I'm not
5:42
saying anything crazy if you didn't know
5:44
all this well that's fine but you can
5:45
tell by the events and the things they
5:47
literally say in their videos in their
5:49
News Post they want players to level up
5:51
they're making content for 40 and above
5:54
and soon it's going to be mid 40s and
5:56
above because they're not going to keep
5:57
making content for level 40 and 42
5:59
forever either you're going to see that
6:00
start to progress as well but here's the
6:03
catch they say that and yet one of the
6:06
greatest things that we've had for years
6:07
is a catch a mechanic this right here
6:09
the event store they're giving less to
6:11
lower levels and I want really really
6:14
really want to kind of harp on the fact
6:16
that 10% of those players could not
6:19
level up if they wanted to server 710
6:21
server 711 server 202 they're not
6:25
ascended they can't go up if they wanted
6:27
to 714th
6:29
there are servers that even if they
6:31
wanted to get to this mythical
6:33
land the opportunity is not presented to
6:35
them and if they wanted to do that well
6:38
what do they need they need their
6:39
specialty ships they need their
6:40
currencies ex you know all the things
6:42
that the event store can provide if they
6:44
were given more currency goople seems to
6:47
have this idea that if we withhold
6:49
things that will make people level up
6:51
but that's counterintuitive to how
6:52
Gamers play their game and other games
6:55
what proof do I have of that statement
6:57
okay well the numbers that I just shared
6:59
with you how many players are in G4
7:01
today about 70,000 how long has G4 been
7:04
out 4 years right and in four years
7:08
you've only got 11,000 players in G6 and
7:11
another 29,000 in G5 right so quick math
7:16
that's 40,000 players have progressed
7:18
past content that came out four years
7:21
ago now is this content creators to
7:23
blame no I don't think rev and DJ and
7:25
Lube or any of us are to blame our
7:27
voices are not that loud as as a proud
7:29
as I am to be a content creator for this
7:31
game and for you the community I'm not
7:33
that big I can't control all the players
7:35
leveling up or not but what we can see
7:38
through Trends and what players do is
7:40
the players move a heck of a lot slower
7:42
than scopely wants them to because of
7:44
all the force bottlenecks in the game
7:46
and those bottlenecks a lot of times are
7:48
things like special ships and currencies
7:50
that you normally would not be able to
7:51
grab unless you take time because
7:54
players intuitively want to get all the
7:58
things in their game they do not want to
8:00
skip everything now I have been
8:02
screaming ignore fomo have fun don't do
8:04
what you don't want for years but again
8:06
this speaks to The Limited influence a
8:08
content creator can have I can say those
8:10
things all day long but what ends up
8:12
being true players want to do the
8:15
content they want to do the Mantis Loop
8:16
they want to get the Mantis they want to
8:17
get the Titan want to get the ceritos
8:19
they want to get the vdar they want to
8:20
get the Voyager they even get the Saros
8:22
and the amalgams and all these different
8:24
things in the 30s that slows them down
8:26
and without scopely giving the materials
8:28
needed to Ain those in a more
8:30
expeditious manner they stay lower
8:33
leveled again over 130,000 players below
8:36
level 40 and about 10% of them couldn't
8:40
go above which means 90% of them could
8:43
and they don't why they need more stuff
8:46
so it's doesn't make sense it's not
8:49
logical to withhold currency under the
8:51
threat of leveling up all you're doing
8:53
scle is making your problem worse give
8:56
them the currency there's no reason that
8:58
lower level players players should get
9:00
half of what higher level players are if
9:04
your goal is truly to get these players
9:05
to level up if anything it should be the
9:08
opposite you should get more cursy at
9:10
level 35 than at 55 so that you can
9:12
catch up and move am I crazy here it
9:16
truly I know I'm getting emphatic and
9:18
I'm getting very animated but am I crazy
9:21
like is the logic they're using not
9:23
counterproductive we want people to move
9:25
up to get into the content and we're not
9:27
going to give them events or stuff to
9:28
get into the cont content I mean maybe
9:31
I'm crazy but I think there's a reason
9:33
that 70,000 players are still in G4 and
9:36
not in G5 and definitely not in G6
9:38
there's a reason that there are so many
9:40
players sitting sub 40 who've been
9:42
playing the game two three four five
9:44
years hopefully you have to be more
9:47
rewarding with the economy and if the
9:48
goal truly is to get players up into the
9:50
content that they want to participate in
9:52
and you need to be more liberal more
9:55
open more generous not withholding
9:58
that's just simply not how things are
10:00
going to work and the numbers back that
10:02
up it's not just the content Creator's
10:04
opinion I don't have control over when
10:07
people level up but I can tell you this
10:10
I can observe that they don't I can
10:12
observe that they sit around and they go
10:14
well dang it what am I going to do I can
10:16
observe that if I go here and look at
10:18
level
10:20
39s we've got an amazing astounding
10:23
almost 7,000 people still sitting there
10:25
and
10:26
remember not that many are forced to sit
10:28
there they're not forced a lot of them
10:30
are there because they have to be
10:32
scopely be more giving with your
10:35
currencies you want players to level up
10:36
I want players to level up too I
10:38
encourage that I fight for ascensions I
10:41
try to make these things happen and I
10:42
don't think that players should spend
10:44
six eight months just sitting at level
10:45
39 but this is what happens is when
10:48
players can't get what they need they
10:50
cannot achieve the content that's
10:51
available to them they sit and they work
10:53
on that content until they do do you
10:56
want people to level up give 500 600,000
10:58
of inst store currencies that everybody
11:00
has meridians Titans bors
11:03
Etc let them
11:05
move or continue to sit there and give
11:07
200,000 currency have an angry player
11:09
base and still have players who don't
11:11
level up let me know what you think if
11:13
you're watching this video do you agree
11:14
disagree do you understand their
11:15
methodology I could very well be wrong
11:18
let me know in the comments section down
11:19
below like subscribe if you haven't
11:21
already live long in plunder stay safe
11:22
with their Space Cowboys Deuces that's
11:24
me it's my hope that videos like this
11:25
will induce change with scopely and that
11:27
only happens when people like you
11:29
support so great appreciation we'll see
11:31
you on the next video I'm out an even
11:34
better outro than the intro for the
11:37
Empire and glory to your house

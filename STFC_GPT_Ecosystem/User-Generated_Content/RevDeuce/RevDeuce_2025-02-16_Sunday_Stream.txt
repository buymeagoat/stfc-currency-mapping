for

[Music]
1:57
you
2:13
[Music]
3:18
[Music]
4:02
[Music]
4:09
all right that works all right let's get all this music turned down let's go ahead and get talking so this right here
4:16
I'm assuming y'all been pulling it not why why would y'all not pull that but anyway if you have been pulling it and
4:23
maybe you missed the announcement on it well this is what you should be doing because it's going to give you more neutrinos now how you generous is the
4:30
RNG uh it's more generous than other rngs right it's 50% for the 3600 36% for
4:38
the 6,000 12 for the 12 and then two for the 24 very curious to what's see I'm
4:45
going to get now I got a good one yesterday on this account and today I got the six so I got the 12K yesterday
4:52
on this and this is the lower level count and now I got the six honestly a pretty good roll now I do want to talk
5:00
about what the total are going to be I did post it in my Discord but acknowledging and realizing that not everybody reads that so we're going
5:08
ahead and talk about it we'll go through that I get through all my clicks and then get y'all's thoughts as well as go over any recommendations y'all might be
5:14
asking for the event store itself in terms of what to get and then uh you know well all the other normal topics
5:19
that y'all will bring up DW says even though I pulled the 24K today I really wish they had just done it fixed him out
5:27
well here's why it is the way that it a lot of us who are arguing for more
5:32
were saying people were short over 200,000 we're getting scop to just give a gift of 200k is well let's just be
5:39
honest that's an impossibility it's just not going to happen not that I'm trying to be a Negative Nancy getting scope would to just give out 200k just not
5:46
happen however getting them to release an RNG based hey we're going to
5:51
guarantee we give them 40K but maybe they get 80 or maybe they get 120 that's more doable so here we are um it's it's
6:00
not a perfect system by any stretch but it is better than the nothing burger that was going out so far o says they've
6:08
gotten 6K and if you manage to get you know a just a few 6ks you end up with a
6:14
pretty nice little bonus again if you are in the mid level and above range you're already expected to be getting
6:21
around 400k now um maybe we end up seeing that be a little bit less a
6:26
little bit more but still solid amount and if you lower level in terms of being
6:31
like level 35 you're expected expected to probably end up around 200 plus so better right is it a
6:40
perfect system again I'm not going to argue that it's a perfect system but from where we were before particularly
6:45
for the lowers I do think it was a step of a fantastic Direction I have added
6:50
this into the uh website spreadsheet so the Google sheet that we have here
6:56
started here remember be pulling it every day and then we're keeping keeping track of the current currency where
7:02
everybody's at depending on your level so I don't know how far y'all have managed to progress in fact if you want
7:08
to shout out your currency numbers in the chat that'd be cool and we'll see where everybody is sitting at but know
7:14
if you want to do your currency numbers do your currency numbers and your level put out your level and your currency numbers so we can see where everybody is
7:21
sitting at but I mean overall I I do think this is a nice improvement though
7:27
obviously I'm not going to advocate for everybody just widely accepting this I think it could have been better but is
7:33
nice to have it's a free claim every day guaranteed to get something and you know what that's better than what we had so
7:41
let me know where y'all are at opsw and how much you're pulling noon whistle says he got 12K yesterday 3600 today I
7:46
am curious to see if anybody's managed to do 2400 or I'm sorry 24,000 two days in a row that would be some insane RNG
7:55
highly doubt anybody's pulled that off but if you have bring it up in the chat I'd love to see it dbo say they got 6K
8:01
both days on both of your accounts Dumbo or just on the lower level higher level which account which you count Sam says
8:08
at op 61 they got 6K and 12K today that's actually what I got here on the lower level count was I got 12K
8:14
yesterday and 6K today so 18,000 more Vin stor currency is that's a lot for a
8:20
low-level account considering what it was getting before now we got some numbers coming in Mark says he's Ops 37
8:27
is got 111k so far all right little little bit lower than I would hope for you to have but I
8:33
mean still better than some I've got some people who are only around 40,000 at that level so that's nice let's see
8:40
Lou good to see you good to see Raven says he's got 3600 both days that's 7200
8:46
more loot o 46 has 318,000 total but got a 12K pull yesterday and a 6K pull today
8:52
and this is what I'm going to see a lot of I'm want to see a lot of people who are getting just uh great RNG where they
8:58
get absolutely nothing right or they're getting Bas well I don't want to say nothing that's not fair they're getting 3600s and then you
9:04
going have these people who are like yeah I got the 12 and the 24 and back to back 24s and hey that's just how RNG
9:11
goes you're going to have people just by the nature of RNG you're going to have some people who are unhappy some people
9:16
are happy that's just how RNG Works no matter what type of mechanic we're referring to by its existence somebody's
9:23
got to be horrible like somebody's got to be screwed but at least you're getting something pause so at least the
9:30
RNG is not 50% roll for zero 20% roll for 3K I mean we'll see off 49 got 6K
9:37
and 12K today congrats War spell and then Rob says question about scrapping doesn't scrapping a Max Enterprise a and
9:42
jelly max out the Enterprise D will not max out the Enterprise D you would have to scrap a lot of Max Enterprise A's to
9:49
max out an Enterprise D but it does help yeah it helps like I'm not going to be able to build a Max Enterprise D in a
9:57
month and I will be scrapping obviously can't see it here because wrong account but I'm scrapping an Isis
10:03
jelly now and I'm not going to jump right into a Max Enterprise D but I will have an Enterprise D ready to tear up
10:09
soon as I level up Evan says level 67 500k total are you happy with that
10:16
amount Evan or indifferent he says my alliance has been able to complete AUM formata sorry to hear that uh well
10:23
that's rough don't know what cruise and stuff yall running but as always we're happy to give advice also got to go do
10:30
oh I shouldn't have clicked this I got to go grind this out so I can do my charge Nano probes oh boy okay well I'm
10:35
going to go ahead and Swap this and then when we get done with the
10:41
board Cube I'll do that and then we'll switch to server 20 so Ops 56 212k so far well what do
10:49
you think about that Charles uh do you think that's good or not because obviously Ops 56 you've had the ability to get a little bit more than that Pure
10:56
freeo Play not much more than that are you happy that amount or do you feel like that's a uh an e amount what do you
11:03
think Charles good to see by the way Evans pretty happy with theirs good to hear o 46 any good place to get G4
11:09
broken ship parts that doesn't affect factions when killing hostiles oh yeah silent hostiles there you go I mean just
11:17
about most of the specialy hostiles that are in the game right now when I say most a lot of the new Specialties they
11:23
come out with like silence just as an example do drop a lot of broken ship parts and obviously are not going to affect your reputation at all
11:31
so yeah L hostiles are another one yep yep
11:39
there's several different places you can go and do that grind if that's what you're looking for yeah you can absolutely pick those up so you did miss
11:46
an event for 12K yeah and the 12ks are two-day events I had somebody messaged me this morning like hey Rev there's no
11:52
event today well that's because the event was yesterday and today it's a two-day event that's a 12K and remember
11:58
every single events like singular events are 6K events so if there's a double in
12:03
there it's going to be 12 and they'll throw in like a heroic there's actually a Krum solo heroic right now which is
12:08
30,000 that's where they're going to put in the juice how much can I damage a 30 a
12:14
little bit here we'll we'll uh hit all these other things might as well charge something
12:20
I'm using the cube finished off my nsabp so I have no idea how much I've gotten that's fair
12:26
Gary and I understand you know people kind of Rush ing into that not that I'm saying that in a negative way but I mean
12:32
if you were going to unlock The Vindicator in the NCA better to do it now I mean I've got to do my NCA grinding cuz today's Sunday here on um
12:40
server 20 here in a bit so plenty of work to be done ladies and gentlemen plenty of work to be
12:48
done all right yep let's
12:54
go I would spin them on amalgam VPS need a third amalgam for rating
13:00
okay that's some hardcore rating I mean I'm not judging you I'm surprised there's somebody who wants three amalg
13:06
for rating but you know what I like it I embrace it very nice the heck is is that
13:11
mopsy again been texting me a lot like on the actual phone weird does that all
13:18
right we're fine okay are they going to do specially building event anytime soon nope don't I'm going to tell y'all for
13:24
the four millionth time stop hoarding special building currency build the things upgrade the things you're not
13:31
getting a event that is going to be better than what you would get from just getting the bonuses now upgrade your
13:37
buildings stop holding on to stuff upgrade upgrade upgrade that's my recommendation those events typically
13:44
only happen when they come out with a new building they don't there's not a
13:49
consistent oh upgrade building event upgrade your buildings now don't
13:55
sit there and hold on to stuff um there are things that can make sense for camp like for Alliance tournaments remember
14:00
an alliance tournaments is 3 days away this Wednesday we have Alliance tournaments again and it makes sense to
14:06
hold on to some things for that purpose but generally speaking don't just sit
14:11
there and sit on things like Building Material CU that that's just going to hurt your account not help your account
14:17
so you now as Denwood says the command center can be a singular exception to
14:23
that rule but even then that's only going to really apply for upper level command centers as well so you got the
14:29
Whip and almost have the Vindicator congrats MJ that's pretty hecking cool and uh super helpful for you good job
14:36
thumbs up that's a I would say a successful event store building a formally pay only item and getting The
14:43
Vindicator without having to do PvP Arenas I would say that is a a win I would assume you would say the same but
14:50
yeah I would assume that is a a Big W for congratulations only thing I find weird
14:55
is that the elite BP only gets 12K this month usually getes more like 40 or 50 it it is different vexing as I said like
15:01
last night on Twitch the big thing really is are we getting the amount not
15:06
how we're getting the amount because a lot of things are actually different so if you look over here the free track 9600 the PID track 12 this is normally
15:13
more however you also have the New Missions 6K this is usually more but the
15:21
main thing is you're getting the currency because if you go back say Last Time Around Mission key Hunter 18,000
15:28
for the AMS 4500 uh free track and Elite Track was 50,000 combined but here's the thing
15:37
this month has is currently on Pace to give you more currency than this month
15:42
so like this actual month February is on Pace to do more than this which was back
15:48
in December so as long as you're getting more currency I guess it doesn't really matter how they're giving it but you are
15:54
right they did lower the amounts that pay out through certain events and through things like the battle pass but is again as long as players get what
16:01
they need I'm kind of indifferent to how they get it I just want them to get it so yeah you are right though a lot of
16:08
things would give out bigger chunks in times past even just recent history give
16:14
out much bigger chunks so it is strange though and I I completely get you there got a let's see unlocked anax last night
16:20
don't have sud oreski yet what would you suggest for side cars um I'll be honest I wouldn't I mean cuz Synergy is right
16:28
the whole thing with boosting his Captain's ability you can run it without obviously that's only
16:33
going to limit you to 30% whereas you could be 50% so in that case I'm going to run things like Enterprise E data on
16:40
one side and on the other side I could do Jane Wes for more ISO Cascade just really go pure Cascade your Firepower uh
16:48
if you want to just go crazy with loot you can put five of 11 on the other side too that way you're getting two different types of loot increases you're
16:54
getting loot chest increase and then Loot drop increase but
16:59
yeah that's cesa is going to be the easier one to obtain it seems because I don't really see the free way for sud
17:06
yet cesa is obviously through your new loop with the relativity I've actually
17:11
almost got cesa unlocked myself through the relativity obviously not everybody has that but at least that has a path
17:17
that we can see and work on so epic W you're proud well I'm glad
17:23
nice what's the best to do with nutras now I did put out a video Reliant uh for me again depending on your level the top
17:29
items in this are going to be different things like Vindicator because not everybody's doing or can do PvP Arenas
17:36
Ina great to jump on the fingy whip paid only item that is great now to get as a
17:42
freeo play huge the dyum um dolamide
17:48
because you can get a free Prime with those that's huge and definitely worth grabbing oh and a scout is definitely
17:54
worth grabbing as well so depending on how much currency you have I would order the top two things for most people ringy
18:01
Whip and Vindicator however I do want to add a caveat if you don't already have the extra fleet commander spot that also
18:07
needs to be right up in there in that same list extra fleet commander Whip and Vindicator are the top three then I
18:14
would say the dolamide and then after that things like the nsea and then eventually you get down to the officers
18:19
and such but that's how I personally would frame it I'm not sure if anybody disagrees and if y'all do have various
18:25
recommendations remember the open Forum y'all are more than welcome to share your S as well loot chest increase isn't
18:30
as good as originally advertised so limited um I don't agree because as
18:36
originally advertised it was said exactly how it's was going to work I don't I guess I don't know where you're getting that is what I'm really
18:42
saying so I I don't know what he was advertised
18:48
for you like who said what but I like anx a
18:54
lot I'm a big fan of anx I think he's one of the better PVE officers in the game just depends on what you're trying
18:59
to grind there are definitely grinds I have that he will be the replacement like he will be the main thing I grind
19:04
with there are other things I won't grind with him at all it just depends on what it is so I love his ability
19:13
so it just depends I don't know how it was sold so I can't really speak to that
19:19
end of it but I can tell you I love anax and will be using him in the future it
19:24
just depends on what grinds you're improving for me if I can improve grinds even simple things like if I was level
19:31
42 again and I was able to use him for the nxo1 grind that'd be huge especially starting out
19:37
depends so so he he works on a lot of important
19:42
chests and he even works on some things that aren't listed we covered that in my video Va doesn't work on literally every
19:48
chest in existence be awesome if you were for dropping more Sigma speed UPS yeah
19:53
you're just going to have to go out and grind in mirror space and try your darn ridiculous but
19:59
heard I mean yeah it'd be great if everything worked on everything sure but I don't think that means he's bad I
20:06
think he's just Nisha and what he not Nisha didn't even right work CU Nisha always has negative connotations and
20:11
honestly Nish is negatively connotated for a good reason I don't even think he's Niche I just think that he works really well on several loops and there's
20:18
other things he doesn't work well on and it depends on what Loops you're working on he might be useful for you he might not
20:23
be o 57 I really don't need most of the things his ability boost that's fair my
20:29
only counter to that glyph would be I think that's completely fair for you you're in the top at that level you're
20:35
in the top 15 to top 10% of all players that means that he is by default now
20:43
effective for 90% of the other players so is it not 100% why are you not
20:48
letting me be this okay thank you so again if it's not useful for you that's completely awesome he continue using
20:55
maybe Mirror parar Mirror data 5 of 11 like that's what what I use when I do my mirror runs right now just I go full
21:02
Loot and try to get as much rep as possible and get as many boxes I can in
21:07
that time take advantage of it so only missing three officers Naga
21:14
mirror Hera and anax so zah here are you going after anax or are you just kind of not going to push very hard this time
21:21
around how are you approaching it yay Pinnacle of power that has opened up a
21:27
research tree for me so that's kind of neat honestly that's kind of neat yeah if you going after I would love to
21:35
know some PE in my alliance are wondering about threat from Beyond do they have plans for it no I mean what
21:42
the real question I mean right from Beyond I'm assuming you're talking about like swarm Sunday is I wouldn't call it
21:49
a dead mechanic it's a mechanic they've Ended as it it's still available for lower levels but when you get to a
21:54
higher level it's not even there anymore and you just get a claim hey here the charge that you were getting on Sundays
22:00
has been replaced by the nsea the nsea mirror loop on Sundays is now the new Sunday task form is really only there
22:07
for lower level players and then once they move past it they are getting you know these new event which is for
22:14
focusing on doing your grinding in mirror space particularly with the NSA so I mean I guess it depends on what the
22:21
question is me it's content that's been completed I don't want to call it dead they actually did put an end to the loop on it which I think is what they should
22:28
do for a lot of various Loops in this game again maybe I'm misinterpreting the
22:33
question all right I'm trying to check go and beam this one I think I get one more beam in before I fill my cargo hold
22:40
anorex allows me as a level 50 to cheese the 62 Aquatics that's useful Harrison very nice that's useful does he work on
22:48
jila yards no not that is content that we call dead content they've not done
22:54
anything with the rare swarm Modas and um I don't encourage people to even
22:59
waste their directives going after them just personally unless you really want to collect Jayla because you're a completionist you want to have all the
23:05
things sure do that to go after Jayla in terms of like me recommending it that would be a no definitely would not
23:12
recommending rare directors are so hard to obtain not recommend blowing rare directives just to get some potential
23:17
Jaya Shard yeah they kind of put an end to loops with the Ia building they to an
23:23
extent they have and I think that's good personally I like that they've done that and there are more things getting added
23:30
into the IIA Loop here in the near future zindy cheese crew still work yes
23:35
Nathan both zindy cheese Crews do still work yes they do yes sir they do let's see what other
23:42
questions I don't want to miss anything you're just one Shard off from unlocking so get tomorrow very nice burn
23:47
pork I assume that means that you're placing in the SLB going on right now or
23:54
are you using the big long meta I am a fan yeah not trying to like pump things up
24:01
I'm a fan of the tier one tier 2 Etc like scaling SMS system now very hard
24:07
for me to score at it here as a lower level player on this account but I'm a
24:12
big fan of the method and then if you do that in conjunction with your leaderboards you can get some good
24:18
rewards in there as far as sourcing goes know we don't have the best relationship
24:23
with consistent sourcing in this game as far as sourcing goes I think that's one of the better uh pass they've introduced
24:29
for you know a mix of spin SL saave go ahead and grab this one down
24:34
here take advantage of both basically very nice very nice stre f netive for second
24:40
without the cheese question yep got to have it Ki uh John if you want to know what all anorex works on check out my
24:45
video because I don't want to just do a every question is a different thing does anorex work on uh check out the
24:52
video Doritos USS Titan or defiant all three like you don't want to skip any of them what do you get first
24:59
uh first I'd probably point you to that's tough defiant defiant and then citos but
25:07
I mean both at the same time if possible like you want all three of them they're definitely not skip ships you want all
25:12
three of them Mar says as a 51 almost 52 using a tier five nsea with anax sudit or Dane
25:19
and Paris tinny Picard H below decks on 48 mirrors getting 165 chest 7,000 is
25:25
faction credits per run very nice Mar faction credits super helpful oh
25:30
somebody cloak nice thought I saw somebody warp in well
25:36
that should have helped me finish I think I finished the daily yes good now we go and do our
25:43
swarm ground wait do Xoom stack yes they do generally speaking yes I get that
25:51
repaired all right that let the helps get in let's do our way teams which is today's big event have all G4 faction
25:59
miners three meridians working on third amalgam but should I try to get the board Cube or focus on something else I would get the board Cube if nothing else
26:05
that you can do what I was just doing which is try to get the extra materials etc for upgrading it even though it's
26:11
not useful until upper G5 G6 it still is a progress and a lot of grinding to get
26:18
all the upgrade particles you still want to be able to do that here and there while you're going through your upgrade
26:23
I would definitely pick it up sounds like you got plenty of miners now I don't feel like you need any more min I think you've mined enough that's enough
26:30
mining get to you know a point in your life where you understand that not everything is hunky dory rainbows and
26:36
sunshines stop singing Kumbaya and uh go beam some things all right get a little violence in you okay it's okay you don't
26:42
have to get rid of all of it you can have a little bit just pido amount of violence okay Peto amount get to it get
26:49
to it all right Health let's see this one hair all right never enough mining
26:57
all right level 50 I'm getting 210 boxes in mirror with a tier eight Ina speed crew very nice Rob those boxes are
27:06
dope those boxes are dope man uh especially the faction credits the the ability for players now to get faction
27:13
credits is so much better than my first couple times through G4 and this one has
27:18
changed a lot of the recommendations I me you can legitimately go for things like the very shiny but very useful very
27:25
pretty that Tribune Enterprise a you know the big ships that people at one
27:30
point were saying skip now are very very good and very very relevant and very achievable so it's nice to have those
27:37
options to attack [Music] two I'll do that and that 20% chance for
27:44
a th we'll go for that that sounds good who suggest that the older offs be made available through transporter patterns
27:50
getting them to add things to transport patterns is a real pain in the neck uh they do add officers but they generally
27:55
add like the a group of officers that people are really needing and wanting is
28:01
typically how they do that so even though there were still some that were missing like five 11 still not being in
28:07
there I've been asking for five of 11 to be in that list since she was five of 10 and you'll have to be a real older
28:12
player to know that I'm not just you know misnaming her literally used to be
28:18
five of 10 they didn't have five of were 11 what I'm saying didn't have
28:24
11 rare offs would be nice I've brought that up before but I'll go ahead and tell you what the number one issue for
28:29
that is just having way too much stuff in there just I I've brought it up they've
28:35
said they're not opposed to it but we're sticking to epics for now we can continue to bring that up though I've
28:41
got no problem bringing it up and I'm sure most of y'all have no problem asking us to bring it up but yeah that's
28:47
where we're currently at with that start a campaign for another Bly go event already in the
28:55
work patient I know telling Star Trek fle man fans be patient is a big ask but
29:03
patient we G get you there all right let me get in here speed this up and then we got to go
29:09
do some probing here six thear nothing about the
29:15
early game that's been nice because of all the power creep and researches you have access to I mean I'm grinding 33
29:21
probes with the tier six nsea and almost filling out the entire cargo pretty nice I actually wish I had more cargo space
29:29
what until we got the Borg mining captains that we suddenly had 11 yeah hey Lord is Karan you been here around
29:35
is Jean Luke B card epic with prioritizing he's nice to pick up he wouldn't be in like my top five but he's
29:41
nice to pick up it's nice to have him and Beverly for that same Pike Maro energization remember you're taking
29:47
advantage of that 1.2 multiplier and that is very nice to have
29:52
so would I recommend getting that sure depends on what else you're going after I still think other things are more
29:58
important Honor Guard War more important for your PVP runs I mean know tendy is still nice as a blow Decker just for a
30:04
little bit of extra Whole Health so depends on what you're doing and it is anous phenomenon day I've already done it on this account but I need to do it
30:11
on the other account Kell so I see Darwin officer sourcing
30:17
yeah I'll be honest like that's not something I can request like they're just going to look at me like yeah I'm we're not going to cater to like the
30:23
0.1% who are just collector because Darwin is as an officer is useless I know why you want Darwin
30:28
but as an officer it's useless so I get it though I understand I know
30:34
why I get it I get it got your pilum yesterday R tier six congratulations RS
30:40
that's awesome that is a significant Improvement good job I mean a tier six
30:46
pilum can kind of do whatever you want it to I would take it a tier s just a little bit little bit further but you
30:51
I'll ride you all the way to 50 you want all right let's see let me check all my things don't have anything in there go
30:58
ahead and do these pulls get all these PS in all the clicks is nice I have a lot less clicks on this
31:05
account there's a way to get a second or third radar Talos negative negative um let's see I don't
31:13
I'm going need that right now port for this pull since we just did that grind and again this is what you're trying to
31:19
get with that board Cube even though my Cube's not really useful right now like I'm not out there using it for PVP they
31:24
want to start working on the upgrade mats then just did anous phenomenon so we get that in there we go and I don't
31:32
care about that Borg and I need to go do the Borg now all right grind first thing we look for is a loot Goblin is there a
31:39
beetle in here no beetles oh there it is grab that first fre to take it to tier
31:45
seven waiting on a teer up event but won't wait too long very nice I mean you have technically an event right now RS
31:53
spin mats on it for your anax unless you just don't want an
31:58
plus you just don't want to enter it is there a good way to get Beverly Beverly Crusher is in the ultra fruit
32:05
pool but that's the only way get Beverly but she's in the ultra recruit pool depending on your RNG there that's your
32:11
uh your sourcing method so uh a away I'm not aw team these Mission Keys FYI
32:19
little bit of reminders for y'all go do your mission keys if you haven't already all right the NCA be better now
32:26
that the dios the say would be better now than the talios on it rev God you got to really work on your spellings you
32:33
redo your video on best ships um I think the Talos and the nsea are both really good the nsea is better in
32:40
G5 but in terms of like G4 no they're about even they're about even both are
32:45
really good and they both are very useful I use both of them for things like OPC hunting and stuff which is very
32:52
very nice and I would encourage everybody to look at both of those for those I again some of y'all really like
32:59
mining we just had a player in here was talking about they have 18 miners 14 amalgams and 7,000 FAS which is great
33:05
but you know what I can do a lot faster than all that OPC hunting and it's more fun you get to meet friends you get to
33:11
go out and see wonderful places I mean how often do you visit these systems probably never but if you OPC hunt
33:16
you'll visit them all the time it's so nice you get out the house a little bit encourage it and the nsea and the tallos
33:23
are both great for OPC hunting they both have good cargo sizes decent DPR and uh they're not one trick ponies I know it's
33:31
a rare thing in the game to have a non- one trick pony but they fit the bill
33:37
they fit the bill so don't do this in real life hey Grand Theft Auto 6 real
33:42
life simulator right well thank you for your lesson with the game Big Man been watching a lot of videos happy to hear
33:47
at comic book Gman thank you for being a patron here I appreciate you and if there's anything I can do to help you
33:53
let me know that's the goal entertain and inform though we do a little bit more of the entertainment over on the twitch side and here on the YouTube side
34:00
a little bit more informative but still more is more better is better Pym is great uses my primary ship
34:08
till I got my 53 so my Pym was great it wasn't better than my tribun when I
34:13
picked up my Tribune but my Pym still something that I used here and there uh the last thing I used my Pym on was
34:19
until about level 53 and I was still using it on my Gorn Loop because of its loot ability I was still using it for
34:26
that now the Pym is has finally been retired I love the Pym I have great memories with the Pym and it was a
34:32
fantastically powerful ship for eight levels seven levels so no complaints
34:39
know when I got my Tribune my Tribune definitely started outclassing it for PVP and stuff but in terms of like just
34:44
general use it stayed valuable for a long time and remember all three rares have the same ability and sadly P5 G6
34:52
ship abilities no longer matter but in G4 you can still pick up some good ship abilities that's what we had with that
35:00
so great chip great chip all right let's go down
35:07
here and grab this and do check my refineries one more time CU feel like I'm missing oh fre two
35:13
stuff you know what I'll do it just because remember at level 39 you
35:19
do need like 3,000 Crystal so if you don't have that two star laying around don't forget about it
35:26
if you are a lower level player ling up you're going to need more of that two star to get your fourth dock I'm sorry
35:32
your fifth dock at level 39 something to keep in mind while y'all are out there
35:38
pay attention all right they add six-star Nosa territory possibly at some point
35:44
there's still so few people in G6 you know again 250,000 is players every day
35:51
little under 11,000 G6 players so changing around territory for those NOS
35:57
doesn't make a lot of sense yet but as we get more and more people in those areas I think it would make more sense
36:03
you'll see that actually open up don't necessarily see that happening too soon but I can tell you that there are plenty
36:08
of people in the VIP chat who are requesting it so definitely not alone if you're out there saying Hey I want that
36:15
there are people out there where yall hunt faction credits mirror space there are a couple different places you can go
36:22
for example doing your Commerce Insignia grind with the board the assimilated
36:28
chips the assimilated cubes that you summon with the Voyager your way to get faction credits via messages but if you
36:34
just want to get straight faction credits you're grinding in the mirror space that's where and I'll be doing that here in a second when I switch
36:39
accounts mirror space grinding super valuable for that and what a lot of people out in the chat are using to try
36:47
to get I would say depending on how many boxes you're pulling I get in one run
36:53
doing a loot run so I'm not trying to be as damaging as possible I'm just trying to be fast I get about 10,000 faction
37:01
credits per hole but there are people who are getting significantly more than that than um I'm doing it because I just
37:07
want to go as fast as possible I don't really care about being efficient I would just rather get it done and get a
37:12
lot done in a short amount of time I run a full loot crew so I run Enterprise Ard Enterprise E data 5 as my bridge I go
37:19
out and mirror and I grind about 300 million faction rep and
37:24
then about 10,000 faction credits could I do better than that yes not going to say I couldn't do better than that I
37:30
could but that's what I do just CU I would rather get it done quickly in one hole and then move on so
37:48
yeah all right let's do old swaero because I've done that grind I only do
37:53
the single pull Shields good let's flip back over because I need to go do that grind right now so let me go ahead and
37:59
send a ship also if you're on 710 with me don't let me forget if I have territory today
38:05
please and thank you you have Dane uh no no pretty sure I don't I might have
38:13
picked him up here recently but actually don't remember if I have Dane or not I think I do wait I probably
38:20
I do have Dane don't I do I let's see yep I got Dane I just never think about grabbing
38:27
him yep I got Dane that'd be better I just
38:32
never think about grabbing him all right when I die y'all remind me to grab him and also when I die y'all remember
38:38
remind me to turn my EXO comps on so y'all remind me when I get back
38:45
because I'm going to blow up I'm gonna head out to miror Chiron do a little bit of grind and then I'll come do it again
38:52
because I'm trying to grind rep as I push for level 60 I'm going to need better rep than I have now so if y'all
38:58
want to remind me that'd be greatly appreciated and feel free to continue asking your questions obviously now we
39:04
head up here start this process as someone who will be making the jump into G5 shortly I'm thinking of getting the
39:10
153 in common to tier five or advanc 56 rare my liance is saying to use max G4 epic to the G5 rare thoughts same thing
39:17
I'll tell you and everybody else do not skip faction ships get a 50 get a 53 get
39:23
a 56 I'll put it this way and this is my Paradigm when it comes to start Le command if leveling Ops to get better
39:30
rewards and better stuff is the only goal this game is not fun because only thing that's going to happen is you're
39:36
going to level Ops you're get closer and closer to the pay wall and you're just going to experience blah you're going to
39:41
experience the need to spend or the need to slow down significantly and be weaker and here's the kicker there is no
39:48
in-game content if you made it to level 70 guess what there's nothing there there's no in-game content there's no
39:54
dungeon you run every day that drops a really cool sword but you got to run 800 times to get the cool sword in my opinion operations focus in
40:03
the game is a stupid way to play now that doesn't mean it's a wrong way to play to me it's stupid because this game
40:09
has no in-game content there's no reason to just rush up Ops play the game and enjoy it pick up
40:17
ships enjoy the process that's my honest recommendation does now be clear I'm not
40:23
calling people stupid I'm saying that idea is stupid there is no up there's
40:28
nothing there right there's no ingame there's not even G6 group armadas there
40:34
are only solo armadas CU there's not enough people up there so I think there's no point in rushing up eight Ops
40:40
even though yes it is a true statement the rewards get better all you're doing is skipping content that you could enjoy
40:46
and because this game has nothing at the end that means you need to enjoy the entire process play the process at your
40:52
pace that's my thoughts and I ask an intimate question
40:57
when you plan on going G6 maybe around Christmas or so but I've already said I'm going to spend a lot of time at level 60 because I'm going to enjoy a
41:04
raran my Enterprise D and my dedex I'm gonna take my time and I'm going to have
41:10
fun and then around Christmas might move on up
41:16
so level 31 105 currency no credit uh for me for the current the lottery
41:22
you're still discriminating against us lower L players it's still insulting and still wrong for it okay but I bet you're I bet you're clicking it every
41:28
day aren't you I bet you're clicking it every
41:35
day yep good to see you Babble welcome in
41:40
any news regarding the field trainings nope negative about pushing to 40 to play The
41:47
Arena I'll be honest as one of the loudest voices of pro arena in Star Tre
41:53
flee command no cuz I'll be honest I think with the speed cap and the current
41:59
ability issues with Arenas that is not a reason to level up in the game and I am one of the biggest Defenders of PvP
42:06
Arenas and anybody that says I'm being a hater is being ridiculous I play PvP Arenas every time it comes around I love
42:12
PvP Arenas but speed cap has taken out a ton of the strategy involved and the
42:18
stability issues that many people are facing I would not recommend you level up Ops to experience that if they
42:24
finally fix some of those issues sure I would I would see the argument for that right now I
42:30
don't so yeah personally I would say no hit 58
42:38
yesterday saving for my push to 60 and then be C be 60 nice I hope you enjoy it hope you enjoy it current level 50 what
42:45
ships going to be my priority to build and scrap ISS jelly that's really the only answer you
42:51
could still be doing like the 28s for ship parts and stuff and the 26s but prioritizing I jell is really the only
42:58
one to prioritize in that level range so getting the ISS jellies Max is you can
43:03
start scrapping them take advantage of them building up your Enterprise a and scrap that for your Enterprise d That's
43:09
the straat so let's see what other we got in the
43:16
list what else we got got my tribute in tier n congrats reum love that got two weeks ago hitting 102 million which now
43:22
ties my Pym at tier 10 debating switching my Metron Cascade to my Tribune or should I wait for Theon
43:28
reactor great question I if you remember went through this same conundrum because
43:34
I loved my Pym and then I love my Tribune and like you get sentimentally attached to them and you don't want to
43:40
like move on from them uh truthfully I say go ahead and move it over it'll be better to have the Metreon Cascade on
43:47
your better ship and that way your Tribune could even start grinding say your level 53 silence that you know you
43:54
want to grind when you move up way you don't miss any on that Loop and as silly
43:59
as it is that Loop is not as valuable as when it first rolled out but it is still access to free primes so would recommend
44:07
grinding it no matter what don't stop grinding it and yeah I think it's time to to pass the torch but it's a tough
44:13
pass I get it it's a very tough pass how's the IE work for ships like
44:18
Franklin Franken eight where we scrap one and get the other almost done with the Frank Loop can't go through it again
44:24
so how it should work is it will recognize you've already ressed it so it's not going to ask you to do it again
44:30
that's been brought up to game design that's what they pass along because it's not in the game I can't tell you for certain because it's not here but
44:36
shouldn't have to do it again that's been made clear by game design that their plan is to not have people do that
44:42
loop again so could be a okay a okay how do you manage to get
44:48
enough ship parts for tear up even with using daily refine All the Time reare explore Parts oh easy Daniel getting all
44:56
your efficiency SE up it's number one number two more than just your refined
45:01
remember you've got gor eviscerator you've got Voyager you got the majoran loop got that daily refine in your
45:07
Refinery there are a lot of ways to get ship parts are you doing all the different ways and are you wasting I
45:13
hate to use the word waste but are you spending ship parts that you don't need to so for example you want to do the ISS jelly Loop you should not be heavily
45:20
investing in an Enterprise a or coronar if you're wanting to make sure you get that jelly done first now see if you Max
45:26
the and you're get in the process of scrapping it the jelly pays for itself and then you'll be getting more rares
45:31
and explore Parts than you're losing but you got to start the process
45:38
so that's how is efficiencies CU it again the whole point of the Isis jell Loop is that you get more in return than
45:45
you spend to Max it and after that point I got to switch down to this direction
45:51
somebody else farming sorry little add brain but then you're going to have plenty of those but it's doing all the
45:58
different loops and the biggest thing I find when people say they're not getting ship parts cuz it is a bottleneck I'm not saying the ship parts aren't a
46:04
bottleneck is are you doing all of the loops or are you just doing maybe one or two of them so to get the ship parts
46:10
which is a true pain in the keer you be doing everything that you can while also focusing on anything that is efficiency
46:17
based if we go to like my SPX CL I can show you where my efficiencies are right
46:23
now U let's do cost calculator I'll just put in the Enterprise D even though I
46:29
don't have one USS
46:34
Enterprise where is it at then I'll put it on the screen don't worry I'm not forgetting about it all
46:39
right go and we'll just say Target tier we'll just say Max just so we can see the cost of how crazy it is but to see
46:46
how much my efficiencies have helped my cost here we go this is my SPO Club here
46:52
are my efficiencies currently my Bild bonuses so rare explor Parts 1361 I'm
46:58
sure there's somebody in chat with a higher number than that right my rares and my epics my ores and gas 916
47:06
877 right parts though 1361 titanium 1642 and again I'm sure there's people
47:13
in this chat who are better you see I've already got all the commons I need to do it but I still need
47:19
more parts of course Etc getting these up is critical and where are those well
47:27
that's what box club for to show you all the different researches you do all the
47:32
things you can be missing for example territory optimize ship upgrades how far can you take it do you have it maxed so
47:39
getting all these things C Commander Lura see I don't have um couple of these
47:45
turned on or I haven't finished upgrading some of these and this one is actually higher now I think I've got it
47:51
at tier three I need to um sync again but yeah so
47:57
these are one of these tools are things that we're always telling people hey you should check these out hey you should use them they're super valuable the
48:03
biggest thing is getting your efficiencies up and remember you can start the free-to-play grind on the Isis
48:09
jelly in terms of the scrap mechanic being profitable as early as level 44 so it's definitely doable it's just
48:16
sitting down mapping out what you need to do and then setting your
48:21
goals as someone who just plays the game solo I really wish they would add jelly to event stores being to territory forc
48:28
me to join Alliance if I want to get it all I can say denro
48:35
is there should be negatives like there should be drawbacks to being solo like
48:42
and for the reason I say this because there should be an advantage to being in a good alliance if there's no advantages
48:48
to being an alliance then why not everybody be solo right I think there
48:53
should be things you miss out on if you choose to play solo and that's fine I'm not saying it's bad I'm not even telling
48:58
you to not play solo but I'm saying that there should be things that you go dang it if I had an alliance I could have
49:03
this that should be how it is so missing out on things like know waves and Miss
49:09
well technically you can still do waves missing out on things like formation armadas right missing out on things like
49:16
is jelly I think is part of the process if you want to play solo and again nothing wrong with that I encourage you
49:21
if you enjoy it play solo but I don't think that everything should be available I think that there has to be things that make alliances
49:28
valuable and that by extension means you're going to make things harder for
49:33
players who choose to not participate in that so do you have the ISS jelly efficiency numbers easily available I do
49:39
in my video about scrapping the ISS jelly Aon uh check out my video on scrapping the is
49:46
jelly now I get what you're saying denro but like as a not against you certainly
49:51
not against you as a player just simply as a point of game design I think it would be bad design to allow a solo
49:58
player to have access to everything that an alliance does see that really ruins the entire point of
50:05
having an alliance and then working to build those relationships I think those should have an advantage that's just my
50:11
thoughts and again if you disagree that's completely fair I'm always happy to have people sit in the chat and disagree with me complely cool so he
50:18
just says strong Alliance give so much ranking higher in aobs turns Etc yeah we mathed it out last year I haven't done
50:24
it here recently but if you're in the top three alliances uh generally speaking you're getting around one to
50:32
two packs per month of free stuff again depending on what level you're at and
50:37
what server Etc but generally between just albs and events like cow and all
50:42
this other stuff you're getting at least one to two free packs a month of stuff they advantages to being in Alliance but
50:48
there also advantages to playing solo less headache yeah way less headache cuz people can be grading absolutely they
50:56
can be grading I say that as somebody with 340 people watching right now obviously not
51:03
talking about any of you y'all are wonderful your mothers raised you right
51:08
but generally speaking I get it I think there should be advantages for players
51:14
uh who who are in a group and going for a common goal so I like doing my own on my own as
51:20
much as possible yeah in general I completely completely support your right to do that I'm just simply saying I
51:27
don't think it's fair for you to choose to do that and then still have access to everything in the game when the rest of
51:32
us need to learn to get along with people like Viper he's British he's a communist he's British I mean come on if
51:39
I have to put up with Viper every day you shouldn't get ISS jelly shards that's not fair to me now I'm getting a
51:46
little crazy but anyway anyway also if you're Canadian
51:53
out there
52:00
a oh some of y'all will get that reference others will not but that's okay good times were had by all at least
52:07
Americans all right little players probably want to avoid the toxicity of the game there can be toxic in the game
52:13
absolutely I personally avoid toxic you know I don't like doing that I don't
52:18
like being around it but I still avoid toxic and I'm in alliances again it's just finding what works for you I'm not saying that everybody has to play the
52:24
same way I'm just saying there are advantages to being being in groups that's all I'm saying so it's a game not
52:31
a social club well Sean this is a social club right remember it's an MMO massive multiplayer online not massive solo it's
52:38
not MSO not massive solo player online it is a social club and that's
52:44
completely fine right most of these Gams are designed around people building
52:50
relationships having community and Lasting long term which is why these work right this game does not last six
52:55
plus years because it's Star Trek no offense to Star Trek I'm obviously a DieHard treky I mean I'm wearing hats you see all the merch and I've had that
53:01
for a long time these games work because of the social aspect so it's definitely a social game
53:09
but that doesn't mean everybody has to play it that way play however you want to play it
53:17
so y Enterprise E you'll have more use for
53:23
than mirror what are y'all talking about I do need to put Dane in here the next time we do this role I I'm remember
53:29
remembering that now don't let me forget to put Dane in there I think most people would stop playing if there were other
53:35
people to play with and against if there I think you mean if there wasn't yeah if there was nobody here I certainly
53:40
wouldn't be making these videos and doing stuff I mean there are games that I can do that with I mean if I wanted to
53:46
just play a Star Trek game that involves no other people those exist
53:51
so I was designed to make it so slow annoying we pull out our wallets sure but that doesn't doesn't mean it's not
53:56
designed with the MMO side of things you must be from the EU with your stupid
54:02
winky face and bad jokes EU people have no no good jokes and always horrible
54:08
winky faces so let's see I sent you mirrorverse crew
54:15
on Discord cool check it after stream check it after stream let's see let's see best part of
54:23
the game is a social piece I agree n i mean we get to hang out together and plane or laugh sometimes cry and that
54:32
makes this place special makes y'all special a lot of ways all crazy Happ in the game the only
54:39
thing that keeps me here is my alliance and hopefully me Brian gosh how many other people on the internet say your
54:45
name out loud show some appreciation why don't you yeah show some
54:51
appreciation all right he Reon I stick around for already three years in is my Lions without them after year I would
54:56
have quit get it Daniel I remember my first Alliance in the game it was first the
55:02
red shirts FST I remember my first Alliance and I remember some of the big names in it
55:08
Mortals and umok and um Immortal umok and medals were the leaders like the
55:15
main leadership group other players in there as well I mean that was six years ago now still remember to this
55:23
day uh UMO with the Paul still actually plays the game they're over in IIA so I've still played with them here and
55:29
there over the past few years yeah they still are in the game I think medals quit a couple years ago and Immortal
55:34
quit like way back in 2021 The Great Well thank you Drake I
55:41
appreciate that I really do very very kind of you thanks to recent events the nsea is
55:48
now my strongest ship by some Arin should I use it for hostiles and armadas or stick to my weaker pilum I would I
55:55
mean depending on which armadas for example you're not going to take an nsea to a borg solo Armada right because the nsea
56:02
doesn't get the advantage versus a borg solo Armada but I mean just grinding regular
56:07
hostiles if it outperforms sure but there are plenty of things that the PM is still going to have the advantage
56:12
because of research and because of ship ability so it's going to draw in more loot natively than an NCA it is going to
56:20
get more um armadas done again because of research it's going to get all the
56:25
faction research which also include rep gain than the nsea that just simply isn't going to have any of those things
56:31
so generally speaking you are still probably going to want to use that as your main what you doing on ship B I
56:38
have no idea what you're doing going to go ahead and grab you over here um generally speaking you're still going to
56:43
want to have the pilum as probably your primary ship but the nsea can get added into the rotation
56:50
right game release the G7 do you know how many credits it would cost to get the new ships no
56:59
more more more I think is the right answer I think it's the easy answer more more all
57:07
right let's see if there's any OPC in here since been here talking about Nas oh that why is that here okay you OPC Diego
57:17
no no OPC anybody what about you OPC no no OPC what about you OPC dag nabit
57:24

58:18
there yay and Rula back we
58:25
go you remember snap snap snap deis Snape that
58:33
guy M G7 epics costing 12 million credits and $10,000 to buy only 10,000
58:39
wow pric is going down playing since the beginning and only ever one Alliance be your server 30 wow that's some real
58:45
loyalty cuz I've been in just on server 20 first feds obsidian
58:52
order IG I a epic
58:59
there's a klling on Alliance I was in for a little
59:05
time I think seven or eight so I guess I get
59:11
around guess I get around Ling your Vindicator nice to hear Drake what do you mean I got to be in the rift I'm
59:16
right there freaking game freaking game
59:26
you mean Dane yes I have danne on there I did switch Dane on yeah I I got SE
59:31
Snape in space yes we did he's right here SN SN seus snap I gotta be on the
59:40
internet a long time ago to know what that is all right yep I got Dane oh my
59:48
Lanta gosh yall can't remind me after I've already done it you lint liquers all right did scopely add a limit to how
59:54
many prime dolamide you can get from the event store yes there is a limit but you can still get an entire primes worth but
1:00:00
there is a limit and yes I agree with you there should be a note on there saying what the limit is 100% agree with
1:00:07
you that there is a limit not counting exchanges before Alliance merge I've been in two first an open one and when
1:00:13
the helpful player left I followed him and since then in the same Alliance nice hogard I think that was them Cory I
1:00:19
think it was cling on Honor Guard nice nice nice nice
1:00:26
it shows oh did they actually show The Limit Out did they actually update it because the last time I had rebooted the
1:00:32
game it did not updated to show that wrong button that's rev you're an
1:00:40
idiot rev you're an idiot two additions yep they added the limit nice
1:00:47
okay scopy I give you a thumbs up for adding the limit there you go there you go all right check my nutrino daily
1:00:55
claim what do we get hey 3600 I got the stock
1:01:00
amount got the stock amount all right we need to go up here to mirror cheron get back to grinding CL your inos
1:01:08
did it did it yeah even with the limit I still think the Dolomite is a fantastic thing
1:01:16
that they added like I really can't gripe at them for a event store this month and with this being the final
1:01:22
month of the ark that means I will be doing doing a survey I'm going to need
1:01:27
y'all to help with and I'm going to tell yall the event store is going to get some uh pauses from me call me a shill I
1:01:35
don't care the VIN store gets a positive me it does call me whatever you need to
1:01:41
they'll be all right V store currency bad 100% disagree
1:01:48
unless you're a lower level player you're a lower level player I agree with that but that still leaves over 100,000
1:01:55
people that should be saying this is a the best event store we've had in well over a year so I guess it just depends on which
1:02:01
level you're coming from with that how high is it worth Ling the G4
1:02:06
miners not high at all not high at all only Advantage really would be warp
1:02:12
range to 39 completely Fair there Felix completely Fair JG says I disagree in 53 has not
1:02:19
been great well JG all I can tell you man is I've got numbers that say it has and I get it you can have personal you
1:02:26
know experiences that differ but if we're talking about whether it's good or not from a general standpoint what 100%
1:02:33
is at level 53 now you personally can just you know not enjoy it and that's okay but it's not it's disingenous to
1:02:40
say it's not good I mean you're going to have more Vin stor currency at level 53 than I'll
1:02:47
actually give you the actual number of months you're going to end up with about
1:02:54
December 2023 three so 14 months the most event store currency in 14 months
1:03:01
and then the best event store offerings probably in years sorry I it's good but you can
1:03:09
still disagree like you can still not enjoy it but yeah that's that's really
1:03:15
good that's finally what we want to be now the thing is need to make it that way for everybody else 53 is that way
1:03:21
but it ain't that way if you're 39 so my currency Numbers Never approach your
1:03:28
estimates it's not estimates Dan hold on real quick I'm not giving you estimates I'm giving you numbers as in if you do
1:03:34
the free tolay SMS events this is what you should have I don't give estimates
1:03:40
estimates would be maximum participation you could have up to over a million
1:03:46
currencies so far if you won all leaderboards Etc actually you could have
1:03:51
maximum 753 th000 up to this point if you had not bought a back and you finished top in every SLB and did all
1:03:58
the paid events and all the freed events you'd be at 753 th000 I'm not giving estimates I'm
1:04:05
giving numbers but opinions are still able to be disagree with so if you're not
1:04:11
hitting the numbers that means you're missing event which again if you're choosing to do that it's fully
1:04:17
fine oh so again JG if you say the currency
1:04:23
hasn't been good all I can respond to is it's the best currency you've had in 14 months and I can always argue for it to
1:04:28
be more and I will but we know that they're never going to return to like the one mythical time over two years ago
1:04:35
where DS9 paid out like 650,000 to free to play like they're not going to do that
1:04:40
again they're not going to do that again I would love that but I just know it's
1:04:46
not going to happen maybe we get like one live Ops person they know this is going to be
1:04:51
their last month and they don't care anymore and they just do it cool like hopefully they'll sneak one in
1:04:57
for the players one last time but there just not going to give people 700 600,000
1:05:04
again why well simple because technically what you're getting now is more than you've ever gotten because
1:05:10
you're going to get 400,000 is freeo play this month and again for certain level players I don't want my 35s
1:05:16
thinking I'm ignoring them but you're not only going to get that but if you compare to what things were two years
1:05:23
ago you were getting no mats this month none zero materials how it used to be
1:05:29
event stores ran that month was a zero mats month all events were Avent store currency all of them now you get mats
1:05:38
and event store currency and this month you're getting around 400,000 you're getting more this month than you as a
1:05:45
player have ever gotten in a month ever if you're talking about total amounts of things you're
1:05:51
getting you can make an argument in terms of material and event store that
1:05:56
this month is the most lucrative in stfc history not everybody wants to make that
1:06:02
argument because we want to just all you know too many of us myself included a lot of times want to be mad at scopely
1:06:09
about so many things but if you're talking about what you're getting this month it is more than anybody has ever
1:06:14
gotten in a month before ever because you're getting mats you're getting choice in mats and you're getting event
1:06:21
store currency so that's why I kind of get like a little defensive on the this
1:06:26
month is bad event store while I'm like how like it's there's not a month you can point to where you got
1:06:33
more so have you had any indication from scopely if the below 42 currency amount
1:06:38
was an oversight or intentional they have not released an
1:06:43
official statement let me tell you what I feel after talking to people intentional and I made this as part of
1:06:50
my video when I made my gripe video they have this backwards logic
1:06:55
where if they withhold it forces people to level up which is stupid that's not
1:07:00
how players play the game my goal is to get them to change that Paradigm because I believe it's
1:07:07
stupid and maybe I should use less harsh language it is a problem with me I'm not diplomatic
1:07:13
enough but their Paradigm is if people need more they should level up I hate
1:07:21
that methodology I do not like that nor did do I agree with it I think that is not how 99% of players
1:07:28
play games so I will continue to fight for people like at level 35 to get an equal
1:07:36
amount so I think that if you want people to level up you give them what they need to
1:07:42
level up not tell them hey be a crappy 39 and go to 42 right now and not be
1:07:48
able to do any of the loops but you get more Vin store currency H I don't like that I don't
1:07:56
like that no it's not not good so I will continue to fight against that way of
1:08:03
thinking but that seems to be the overall Paradigm of the good overlords
1:08:09
over at scopely there any reason I don't want to take my G4 miners to max level if I have
1:08:16
the survey parts for it well you be in my opinion wasting materials like those materials we better
1:08:22
spend on other things faction ships research buildings Etc there's just no
1:08:28
real reason unless you just want to Max him out now I do have a player name is KN of equity he is so OCD and I'm not
1:08:34
trying to say this in a negative way he has to max out everything he does he would have had to max out
1:08:41
everything he does he just does ships miners research can't play any other way and I
1:08:49
guess if that works for him it works for him but me personally I would I didn't didn't even
1:08:55
pick up G4 miners until I ground them out like I was hitting hostiles and got them and I took them like tier five and
1:09:02
my Hydra is the only one I've leveled up a little bit and the only reason I did that was because I was doing spin events I like hey I need something to dump Mass
1:09:08
into real quick I took it to tier eight
1:09:17
so all right let's see there all right let's go and hit
1:09:24
these this this I'm go and get my Q up I've really
1:09:29
fallen for the casar artifact if you can't tell really have all right it's
1:09:34
dumb give players the resources to make upgrading easier that's what I believe tar I
1:09:39
mean I think that if you really want to have more players in G5 G6 Etc make it
1:09:46
easier to get there and if you gave out a ton of stuff in event stores you know a catch-up mechanic that would allow
1:09:52
players to move what's G miners can reach G5 token space the only benefit of tearing them
1:09:58
higher is more cargo I don't even believe it's needed to do that being completely honest with
1:10:04
you why novas novas are cheap Bigger Better Batter stronger they don't have
1:10:10
as much protected cargo but again you got plenty to do your dailies if your goal is to get your dailies done ah man
1:10:16
I'm I don't even again my Nova is my best minor the only minor I use and it's
1:10:22
sitting at a poultry tier three honestly I probably should upgrade it
1:10:27
just for this anax event because I've got the stuff I probably should just do
1:10:32
that but I probably don't want to soak up too much of that gas though thinking about it I need to go look on my SPX
1:10:38
Club I probably don't want to soak up that gas I will need that gas for my Enterprise
1:10:46
D Nova repair bill is 940 well here's the thing tar why does that matter at
1:10:52
all there is no shortage of resources in this game until G6 what something cost
1:10:58
to repair should not matter to anybody in my opinion you are not short on resources unless you were literally
1:11:05
letting yourself get raided every day you were not short on resources between events doing your
1:11:12
monine you do not struggle to have
1:11:17
titanium so I could have my minor blown up a 100 times a day for a year and not
1:11:22
struggle with tritanium well DJ's in G6 though Evan that doesn't
1:11:27
count but even then DJ generally is fine but he's a G6 player and I just said G6
1:11:34
resources are a problem run out of Sigma especially if you're letting yourself get raid can be a problem if you're in
1:11:40
the 30s 40s 50s you should have zero issue with any resource
1:11:46
ever I don't get that argument like you are right it is more
1:11:51
economical to run a G4 minor but why mod is being economical it's kind of like
1:11:57
Elon Musk whoopy dooe he bought Twitter for 40 billion when the man has got
1:12:04
quadrillion billion it doesn't matter he bought it because he wants to have it he doesn't care if it's valued now at 10 or
1:12:12
five or 100 when you have the resources who cares right if you're that rich if
1:12:19
you're rich enough to have a yacht that takes you to your bigger yacht why does it matter and if you're in G4 G5 in
1:12:26
today's game you have enough resources to have a yacht for your yacht you might not have enough ship parts but you've
1:12:32
got enough resources so yeah that's where I stand on that one but there are
1:12:38
other people who are far more diligent on efficiency than me and that's completely fine I just think it's silly
1:12:44
to worry about a Nova repair versus a Hydra repair yes I'm just going to enjoy the
1:12:50
note are your Myers getting blown up so often that you care about repairing them
1:12:56
they do on other servers and I don't run out of titanium
1:13:02
so like yeah there there are servers I play on my miners get hit every 30
1:13:07
minutes 30 to 60 Minutes doesn't bother me at all repair right back on a node
1:13:12
what I will do especially if there's a particular person or Alliance that's hunting is I actually alternate what o
1:13:18
nodes I'm on I don't always go back to the same system same node I alternate where I'm at so it makes it harder for
1:13:24
them to hunt me down because there are a ton of nodes all over the place not only do you have the ones in G
1:13:31
in territory space but let's say you're doing G3 uh just lower levels are here
1:13:36
you can hide out in toat or you can even come down here in Narendra almost nobody comes down in nindra and looks for
1:13:42
miners if you're up in G5 there's nodes everywhere and the independent systems will have nodes that most people don't
1:13:48
even remember exist like here that's a three star one but there are independent ones in fourstar that people forget exist
1:13:56
so for me personally yeah I get hit all the time I don't care but novas are
1:14:02
scary for some people you're all right I mean the power of a Nova will scare a lot of people away
1:14:10
so this Nova is going to scare most G4 players away because if I have a PVP
1:14:18
crew on it that's going to scare most players away who are G4 now upper G4 players are
1:14:25
to laugh at it and hit it but it also has one weapon but that one weapon is a
1:14:31
little beefy it'll hurt you it'll hurt you yeah anyway that's why I fall in
1:14:36
that argument yeah your yacht takes that to your bigger yacht that takes you to your spaceship that takes you to your
1:14:41
space shot exactly d man so yeah I I do agree that tritanium used to be an issue
1:14:47
but for again people who come to my stream 99% of y'all have no issues with
1:14:52
tritanium so I don't get that particular argument so it's all good though it's all good
1:15:01
hey I do battle miners all the time I love it I love battle miners the only
1:15:06
mining crew I think has value in the game today are PV I'm not or well yeah PP crew but protected cargo crew the
1:15:14
only my like people ask me hey Rev are you using you know Eric and grush not
1:15:19
grush uh Eric and quk are using you know Stan to mine your or nope none of that
1:15:27
protected cargo or PVP that's all I do on a minor no point in doing either
1:15:33
anything else in my opinion because those bonuses now that you have so much research even buildings that improve
1:15:39
that doesn't matter anymore so all right let's see how much rep I got so I was at three uh
1:15:47
5985 I got another 300 million right there 300 something million 320 million
1:15:53
and then 6167 yep no 315 million so not
1:15:59
a bad little run not a bad little run got over 500
1:16:04
million rep hanging out with you lug nuts and talking about mining Good Times
1:16:10
quality gameplay quality gameplay also we didn't even open my boxes how about we do that
1:16:16
open the boxes how much faction credits faction credits let's see how much we got who
1:16:21
doggy about 15,000 faction credits and that 100 box pull wo dog and that's not
1:16:28
even all mirror uh mirror because I've see rare opportunity chips yeah me lacad desically going out
1:16:35
there and getting very nice 15,000 faction credits minimum
1:16:44
and 600 million-ish rep for each faction good day yeah another um another 3,000
1:16:52
faction crit so 18,000 faction credits and 600 million rep that's a good day
1:16:58
that is a darn tooting good day I tell you what can't beat that with a
1:17:04
stick best way to get G5 rare Parts visator Voyager minion and your
1:17:13
provider maybe Max Caro crew for voyage mining Fair Marin fair I don't do
1:17:20
Voyager on any account currently I will need to start doing that on another account here in a couple
1:17:26
months but yeah that one makes sense for the Voyager mining because of the Ia
1:17:33
building now when people get to level 51 they can Max that out and not have to do Voyager anymore which is so nice yeah
1:17:39
that's a solid one to bring up Mir and appreciate it between mirror and DTI getting fkr
1:17:45
rep and credits is so much faster yeah which is why I've been saying for months now hey get that 50 Epic if you want it
1:17:51
it's no longer a bottleneck like it was you can do it it's actually feasible now
1:17:56
you can still skip it if you want there are plenty of people who are going to be like hey Rev skip this I'm like no but I
1:18:02
understand if you do but I mean if if you're wanting to enjoy something cool and obtain something that you got to see
1:18:08
like the the whales have and you're like man I'll never be able to afford that well now you can afford it go ahead and enjoy it have a good
1:18:15
time and let me get my lad push 50 to 53 on the weekend
1:18:20
congrats Gary did you pick up a 53 ship and if so which one I'd to hear I really
1:18:26
would I'd love to hear we do uh traits this that and that 85 I probably should
1:18:33
go ahead and Max that out but doesn't really matter I guess because they still haven't added anything to it and let's
1:18:39
do traits again need as much latinum as I can get
1:18:45
go Forest first why no Kling
1:18:51
on why don't you love us Klingons are better get the
1:18:57
Klingons don't be a loser got your Akira grass chatter
1:19:03
awesome should I get my four Sky the answer is yes more sis is more better if
1:19:08
you're into mining in G6 everybody's favorite task more is more absolutely oh
1:19:15
look at that I'll get that that I have an engineer I do look at that 75 I'm
1:19:21
going to get me a whopping 97 uncommon gas what an amazing
1:19:29
payout absolutely crazy green BAC says pick me okay I will tell this and I will
1:19:35
acknowledge it it does look cool where's my corvis there it is it does look cool obviously
1:19:43
I did not invest in it because I invested in the north cut and the VOR why I do all three but it does look
1:19:49
cool it is a nice Romulan battle axe but this is gorgeous this is
1:19:56
gorgeous sir good
1:20:02
stuff yeah what else are you going to spend ATA credits on once you get up to
1:20:08
48 plus anyhow well if you're like rev and you're really bad at the game
1:20:15
and you've not maxed out your Outlaw it sits right here you could also I mean technically
1:20:22
I've got nothing to spend it on I'm saving in the that they finally add something in here
1:20:27
but I could go get a whopping 18 million Klingon reput let me tell you what oh my
1:20:36
doggy at what level can you build a seventh dock free to play you cannot the seventh and eighth docks are paid only
1:20:43
those are docs G and H now you can purchase those as early as level but you cannot get seven and eight
1:20:51
free to play you can get six docks free to play you seventh and eighth docs are currently paid only however we are
1:20:57
seeing more and more forly paid only things becoming available to the general public through various event stores such
1:21:04
as the flea Commander spot and the fingy Whip and I have been advocating them to add more docks and if they add another
1:21:10
paid dock makes sense to then give away a free dock from level 30 so I have been pushing for that believe it or not I
1:21:17
would love for more people both free to play and Spinners to have more docks I think it's something that everybody here can agree on they need more docks
1:21:25
also more formation Armada directives I need to do this I need to do this that's it's on
1:21:31
the list also cesa soon soon sesa I did get the strand of Krum hair I've got
1:21:36
that at year one I do also thinking about it need to go grind that loop I
1:21:42
told you about was silence go grind silence so I can get more of the free-to-play
1:21:48
drip I'm out of currency you have one .2 trillion that's
1:21:55
not even a part of my safe 1.2 trillion what Dre I came out of nowhere with that
1:22:00
on me I gave up hoping myself and just slow drip the Enterprise a and Tribune well hey Don you have to slow drip it
1:22:07
now man get to grind it I say let's see let's just do some quick math if I only relied only relied on grinding in Mirror
1:22:16
how long would it take me to grind a million credits take me 66 days
1:22:22
to grind a million credits in mirror and I granted that be dispersed amongst three factions say if I only did mirror
1:22:27
grinding I could grind a million faction credits in 66 days assuming I did it basically 100 boxes I did a 100 boxes of
1:22:35
mirror a day that alone not counting away teams not counting DTI not counting
1:22:40
anything else 66 days to get a million faction credits definitely doable it's
1:22:51
doable all right let's uh back out of that real quick got to get this leveled up me check my
1:22:58
buildings so high as it can be war room is stuck for you know everybody else oh
1:23:03
I can upgrade this save it all right so we're talking about save things this is something I have to save for Wednesday
1:23:10
for the away Alliance tournament remember this is a free-to-play event because you all
1:23:17
everybody messes up and tries to go get the um uncommon materials for upgrading flea
1:23:23
Commanders actually get it from this building upgrading so let me pull up the tournament list show youall which one
1:23:30
I'm talking about
1:23:40
second all right out here acquire 1500 uncommon skill
1:23:46
points this one so freeto playay Alliance tournament
1:23:54
tasks 10K task save this if you have it that's how you do it that's how you
1:24:01
do it all right go pop this back it's got my second 15 Bill faction lock today
1:24:08
only one more left then I can uh swear off faction grinding for a long hecking time yeah I'm I plan on doing that soon
1:24:14
I obviously I'm trying to work on it now because I need to get up there so I can do my Enterprise D and stuff but I'm
1:24:21
working on it working on it I am you know a little bit more than a third of the way there so not sure it's ever been brought
1:24:28
up but the ability to use faction credits to purchase other faction credits use clling on to get fed crits and so on be cool been brought up before
1:24:36
um I don't know if they're going to work on a transfer or exchange like that but it has been brought
1:24:42
up let's see other questions I don't want to
1:24:47
skip I wish they CH wish they choose your rewards are more even now at op 60 only Crystal has epic that's how it's
1:24:54
always been Joseph I agree with you I don't know if and when they're going to change that but they're only doing that because that's how the battle pass has
1:25:01
always been should it change sure sure they just happen to do that in the
1:25:06
battle pass give that epic out I have no idea if and when it's going to change but all they did is just
1:25:13
copy and pasta what the battle pass is paying out previously into that so he
1:25:18
spent one month going from around 15 Bill to 500 Bill no more rep grinding until the event eventual G7 release TJ
1:25:26
you are a tryhard you're Deuces donut and I love you try hard and a Deuces donut and I
1:25:32
love you all right so I got to get these done really tempted to end the joke
1:25:38
honestly really tempted to end the joke I got to get these done finish doing these I've still got
1:25:44
several things to upgrade here to get all my docks and stuff done though
1:25:50
that's cool so I've made progress then when are they going to add more to this talking about things they need to come
1:25:56
back to I loved when this came out they need to add in stages 11 through 20 we
1:26:02
need stages 11 through 20 in this like come on don't forget about this this is a
1:26:08
great little I I think this is neat some people think it's stupid I truly think
1:26:13

1:26:21
it so why it's fun I like it I like it if you don't like it
1:26:28
don't do it I want more I want more all right back to the comments finding out
1:26:35
at Ops 32 I'm still falling behind on my cruise badly as I'm saving for chips for the V crit should I just be ping for a
1:26:42
good bit if you're going to camp in that range I would suggest level 34 or
1:26:47
35 but yeah there's nothing wrong with slowing down and setting goals I'll say that all the time if you're ready to
1:26:54
move move up move up if you want to slow down and achieve some goals nothing wrong with that either makes sense makes
1:27:01
sense also last night for those that missed it cat did um make me invest in
1:27:07
the board Cube so we took the S to tier six this is the board cube with one part
1:27:13
left before it's as high as I can take it actually means I need to actually go grind with the board Cube so I can do
1:27:20
more of the support refinery right here oh I actually have that to
1:27:26
pull now but I still need to go do more and get more oh anomalous phenomenon let me go

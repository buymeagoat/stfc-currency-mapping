USER: how do I get a taurean spear artifact shard?

ASSISTANT: The provided data does not specify **how to obtain** the **Taurean Spear Artifact Shard** specifically. The *currency_sources.json* file, which maps how currencies are acquired, does not contain an entry for this artifact shard.

To determine its exact source, you may need to:
1. **Check in-game event stores**: Artifact Shards are often available in special events or artifact-related stores.
2. **Look in artifact research mechanics**: Some shards can be refined or acquired via artifact research.
3. **Monitor Battle Pass rewards**: Some artifact shards have been included in Battle Passes.
4. **Explore artifact-related events**: Some shards drop from artifact-specific events.

If you have additional data on artifact shard sources, you can update your **currency_sources.json** file and re-upload it. Then, I can cross-check and provide exact acquisition methods!

# Currency List and Links
Date: 2025-03-09

USER: Let's start building out a list of every type of currency in the game and storing it in our static files. After that, I think we should start determining how every currency links together.

We should make a canvas document that just lists every single currency. What do you think about this approach?

ASSISTANT: I'll create a canvas document listing all known currencies in **Star Trek Fleet Command (STFC)**. This will serve as a foundation for tracking how each currency connects to different in-game mechanics.

ASSISTANT: {"name": "stfc_currencies", "type": "document", "content": "**STFC In-Game Currencies List**\n\n---\n\n### **Primary Currencies:**\n- **Dilithium** – Used for ship upgrades, research, station construction, and repairs.\n- **Tritanium** – Common currency for ship repairs and upgrades.\n- **Parsteel** – Primary currency for station upgrades and repairs.\n\n### **Faction-Based Currencies:**\n- **Federation Credits** – Used to purchase items in the Federation Faction Store.\n- **Klingon Credits** – Used for purchases in the Klingon Faction Store.\n- **Romulan Credits** – Used for purchases in the Romulan Faction Store.\n- **Rogue Credits** – Used for Rogue store transactions.\n- **Borg Nanoprobes** – Acquired via Borg systems, used for specific upgrades and purchases.\n- **Actian Venom** – Used for Ex-Borg related exchanges.\n\n### **Event & Special Currencies:**\n- **Recruitment Tokens** – Used to recruit officers.\n- **Event Store Currency** – Changes per event cycle, used to purchase limited-time rewards.\n- **Battle Pass Points** – Earned through events, used to progress Battle Pass tiers.\n- **Alliance Credits** – Used for alliance store purchases.\n\n### **Upgrade & Refinery Currencies:**\n- **Uncommon Refined Materials** (Crystal, Gas, Ore) – Used for upgrading ships and research.\n- **Rare Refined Materials** (Crystal, Gas, Ore) – Required for higher-tier upgrades.\n- **Epic Refined Materials** (Crystal, Gas, Ore) – The rarest upgrade materials.\n- **Iso-Resin** – Used for territory capture-related upgrades.\n- **Borg Cube Alloy** – Specific to Borg-related upgrades.\n- **Plutonium Isotopes** – Used in specific ship or research upgrades.\n\n### **Officer & Ship Currencies:**\n- **Officer XP** – Used to level up officers.\n- **Ship XP** – Used to level up ships.\n- **Officer Shards** – Required for unlocking and upgrading officers.\n- **Ship Blueprints** – Needed to construct new ships.\n- **Fleet Command Badges** – Used for promoting officers.\n\n### **Reputation & Store Currencies:**\n- **Faction Reputation Points** – Determines access to faction stores and benefits.\n- **Reputation Tokens** – Used for faction standing boosts or adjustments.\n- **Exchange Credits** – Used in special event-based or cross-faction transactions.\n- **Latinum** – Premium currency for speeding up actions and special purchases.\n- **Merits of Honor** – Used in Honor stores for officer and ship-related items.\n- **Rogue Reputation Points** – Used to determine Rogue store access.\n\n### **Miscellaneous Currencies:**\n- **Charged Nanoprobes** – Used in refining and purchasing Borg-related items.\n- **Assimilated Nanoprobes** – Acquired from Borg-related events and systems.\n- **Transwarp Cells** – Used for accessing special locations.\n- **Data** – Used in Outlaw research and Rogue store transactions.\n- **Plasma** – Used in exchange stores for high-value rewards.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps:**\n- **Mapping Interdependencies** – How each currency ties to the economy, upgrades, and events.\n- **Tracking Exchange Rates** – Conversion rates between different in-game currencies.\n- **Identifying Event-Based Currencies** – How frequently event currencies rotate and their impact.\n\nThis document will evolve as we refine the knowledgebase. Let’s confirm the completeness of this list before proceeding to interconnect the currency systems."}

ASSISTANT: I've compiled a comprehensive list of **STFC in-game currencies** in the document. Next, we can focus on mapping how these currencies interconnect. Do you want to start with **exchange rates**, **event-based rotations**, or **upgrade dependencies**?

USER: We need to rewrite much of this because there are many missing currencies or general categories of currencies. We need to list every single one. I'm going to tell you what to add. So, let's just start with a brand new document. As I give you new currencies, you add them to our document.

ASSISTANT: {"name": "stfc_all_currencies", "type": "document", "content": "**STFC Complete In-Game Currency List**\n\n---\n\n### **Primary Currencies:**\n(Placeholder - To be filled as currencies are provided)\n\n### **Faction-Based Currencies:**\n(Placeholder - To be filled as currencies are provided)\n\n### **Event & Special Currencies:**\n(Placeholder - To be filled as currencies are provided)\n\n### **Upgrade & Refinery Currencies:**\n(Placeholder - To be filled as currencies are provided)\n\n### **Officer & Ship Currencies:**\n(Placeholder - To be filled as currencies are provided)\n\n### **Reputation & Store Currencies:**\n(Placeholder - To be filled as currencies are provided)\n\n### **Miscellaneous Currencies:**\n(Placeholder - To be filled as currencies are provided)\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps:**\n- **Mapping Interdependencies** – Understanding how each currency connects to the economy, upgrades, and events.\n- **Tracking Exchange Rates** – Documenting conversion rates between different in-game currencies.\n- **Identifying Event-Based Currencies** – Logging their frequency and impact on the economy.\n\nThis document will be updated in real-time as new currencies are added."}

# Verify GPT Functions
Date: 2025-02-23

USER: Step me through verifying the functions of this GPT. I want one test at a time. Keep it simple. What should we do first?

ASSISTANT: ### Step 1: Verify General Knowledge Retrieval  
Let's start by testing if I can correctly retrieve and summarize knowledge from the loaded files.  

#### **Test 1: Basic Query Check**  
Ask me a simple question about **Star Trek Fleet Command** (STFC), such as:  
- "How do faction stores work?"  
- "What are the core mechanics of the game?"  
- "How does officer shard tracking function?"  

Pick one, and I'll generate a structured response based on the knowledge base!

USER: How will you track all of the information about each officer so you can make accurate recommendations about crewing, upgrades, etc?

ASSISTANT: Great question! Based on the **STFC Knowledgebase Data Storage & Classification Standards** and the available templates, officer-related data is tracked using a structured system. Here‚Äôs how I handle officer information to ensure **accurate crewing and upgrade recommendations**:

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Officer Data Storage**
Officer information is stored in structured files like:
- **`20_Officer_Shard_Tracking_Template.json`** ‚Äì Tracks **officer promotion progress, shard acquisition, and upgrade timelines**„Äê42‚Ä†source„Äë.
- **`06_Game_Mechanics.json`** ‚Äì Contains **officer abilities, synergy effects, and stat bonuses**„Äê27‚Ä†source„Äë.
- **`07_Faction_Stores.json`** ‚Äì Details which officers are available through **faction store purchases and their refresh rates**„Äê26‚Ä†source„Äë.
- **`08_Game_Events.json`** ‚Äì Logs **event rewards**, which often include officer shards„Äê29‚Ä†source„Äë.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Officer Data Classification**
Every officer has structured metadata:
‚úÖ **Name & Faction** (Federation, Klingon, Romulan, etc.)  
‚úÖ **Rarity** (Common, Rare, Epic)  
‚úÖ **Abilities & Synergy** (Captain‚Äôs Maneuver, Officer Ability)  
‚úÖ **Acquisition Sources** (Faction Store, Events, Recruitment Chests)  
‚úÖ **Upgrade Requirements** (Shards needed, XP costs)  
‚úÖ **Best Crewing Roles** (PvP, Armadas, Mining, etc.)  

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ How AI Makes Crewing & Upgrade Recommendations**
When you ask about **best crew setups or upgrade priorities**, I follow this process:
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Scan officer abilities and synergy effects** from `06_Game_Mechanics.json`.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Cross-check shard availability** from `20_Officer_Shard_Tracking_Template.json` and `07_Faction_Stores.json`.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Check current event rewards** in `08_Game_Events.json` to see if shards are obtainable soon.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Use structured formulas** to determine **optimal crew combinations** based on ability effects, ship type, and role.  

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Example Query & AI Response**
**User:** *"What's the best crew for PvP at level 50?"*  
**AI Response:**  
‚úÖ *"Based on available officer synergy, ship type, and PvP meta, here‚Äôs a recommended crew setup:"*  
üìå **Captain:** Gorkon (Critical Chance Bonus)  
üìå **Bridge Officer 1:** Khan (Critical Damage Boost)  
üìå **Bridge Officer 2:** Marcus (Armor Piercing Bonus)  
üîó *Source: Officer Ability Data (06_Game_Mechanics.json), Synergy Charts, PvP Performance Logs*

Would you like me to test a specific officer-related query? üöÄ

USER: Many of the files I've uploaded have no data in them. I think we should seed them with some data first. Find the first file which needs seeding and output plaintext I can copy and paste into it so it can function within the framework of this GPT.

ASSISTANT: Good call! I'll check for the **first** file that needs seeding and provide you with structured plaintext data to copy and paste.  

The **first file that requires seeding** is:  
üìÇ **`20_Officer_Shard_Tracking_Template.json`** ‚Äì This file is meant to track **officer promotion progress, shard acquisition, and upgrade timelines**, but currently lacks structured data„Äê42‚Ä†source„Äë.

Would you like me to seed another file, or do you want to review this first? üöÄ

USER: Great, next? I don't care if the data is accurate, just that the contents of the file structure are accurate based on how you know this GPT should function.

ASSISTANT: Got it! I'll continue seeding files in order. The next file that needs seeding is:  

üìÇ **`19_Fleet_Progress_Template.json`** ‚Äì This file is meant to track **user fleet strength, ship upgrades, and progression**, but currently lacks structured data„Äê41‚Ä†source„Äë.

### **Why This Data Is Useful?**
‚úÖ Tracks **each ship's progress** (level, XP, tier, and upgrades).  
‚úÖ Lists **needed resources** for the next upgrade.  
‚úÖ Provides **estimated upgrade timelines** for planning.  
‚úÖ Follows the **STFC Knowledgebase Classification Standards**„Äê28‚Ä†source„Äë.

Let me know if you want another file seeded! üöÄ

USER: I think I see an issue already. The attached files will not contain any information about a user's account, only how to work with the data the user submits about their account within the context of the chat. the attached files should provide the information necessary to evaluate the user's account information and make recommendations. 

I ask you a question about what resources and materials I need to get my enterprise D tier 12. You shouldn't have any knowledge of that answer if I haven't provided you information about my account. So, you could answer with generic base costs of what it costs to tier up an enterprise D to tier 12 from tier 1. However, you should prompt the user to either: 1) provide their account information for better analysis, or 2) answer without account context.

The files will provide you the raw data about base costs, how to apply efficiencies, cooldown times, average refinery and reward yields, things like that, so you can answer either question accurately.

ASSISTANT: That makes complete sense! The **attached files** should **only** contain structured knowledge about **game mechanics, upgrade costs, efficiencies, and economy data**, while any **user-specific details** must be explicitly provided within the chat.  

### **How This Affects File Seeding**  
Instead of storing **user account data**, the files must provide:  
‚úÖ **Base game mechanics and upgrade cost formulas**  
‚úÖ **How efficiencies (research, officers, buffs) apply**  
‚úÖ **Cooldown times, refinery yields, and reward averages**  
‚úÖ **Prompts for missing user data**  

---

### **Next File That Needs Seeding: `06_Game_Mechanics.json`**  
This file should provide **core game mechanics**, like **ship upgrade costs, officer abilities, and resource calculations**„Äê27‚Ä†source„Äë.  

### **Seed Data for `06_Game_Mechanics.json`**  
Copy and paste this JSON structure into the file:

### **How This Works with User Queries**
#### **Example 1: Missing Account Data**
**User:** *‚ÄúWhat resources do I need to upgrade my Enterprise D to Tier 12?‚Äù*  
**AI Response:**  
üìå *"To upgrade an Enterprise D from Tier 1 to Tier 12, the base costs are:"*  
   - **Dilithium:** 50M  
   - **Tritanium:** 75M  
   - **Uncommon Crystals:** 500  
   - **Rare Crystals:** 200  
   - **Epic Crystals:** 50  
üîé *"These values can be reduced based on research, faction discounts, and event bonuses. Would you like to provide your current account efficiencies so I can refine this answer?"*  

#### **Example 2: User Provides Account Data**
**User:** *‚ÄúI have a 20% research reduction and a 10% faction discount. What‚Äôs my cost?‚Äù*  
**AI Response:**  
üìå *"With your 20% research reduction and 10% faction discount applied, your adjusted upgrade cost is:"*  
   - **Dilithium:** 35M  
   - **Tritanium:** 52.5M  
   - **Uncommon Crystals:** 350  
   - **Rare Crystals:** 140  
   - **Epic Crystals:** 35  

---

### **Why This Fixes the Problem**
‚úÖ **Does NOT store user data**‚Äîonly base mechanics.  
‚úÖ **Prompts users** to submit their efficiencies **if they want personalized answers**.  
‚úÖ **Provides accurate generic answers** if no user data is given.  
‚úÖ **Ensures AI responses align with structured game knowledge.**

Would you like me to seed another file now, or do you want to review this first? üöÄ

USER: Is the behavior I'm asking for well-defined in the documents attached to this GPT? If not, I want you to generate new contents which I can copy/paste/attach.

ASSISTANT: You're asking for a **clear separation** between game knowledge (which is preloaded) and user data (which must be provided at runtime). This behavior needs to be **explicitly defined** in the attached documents.  

### **Checking for Gaps in the Documentation**  
I reviewed the attached files, and while some elements align with your request, there is **no document that fully defines this behavior**. The closest references are:  

üìå **`02_Data_Storage_Standards.md`** ‚Äì Defines how data is structured but does **not clarify that user data should NOT be stored**„Äê28‚Ä†source„Äë.  

üìå **`04_User_Interaction_Guide.md`** ‚Äì Covers how users interact with the AI but does **not emphasize prompting for missing user context**„Äê30‚Ä†source„Äë.  

üìå **`03_Testing_Quality_Control.md`** ‚Äì Discusses **validation protocols** but does **not explicitly test for correct user data handling**„Äê31‚Ä†source„Äë.  

### **What Needs to Be Added?**
We need **a new document** (or an update to an existing one) that explicitly states:  
‚úÖ **User data is NOT stored in attached files**‚Äîthe system only uses game mechanics and formulas.  
‚úÖ **The AI must prompt for user-specific inputs** when needed, instead of assuming values.  
‚úÖ **Testing must verify that AI correctly distinguishes between game data and user data.**  

---

### **New Document: `User Data Handling & Query Response Standards.md`**  
Copy and paste this into a new file and attach it to the GPT to define the behavior clearly.  

```md
# **User Data Handling & Query Response Standards**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Purpose**  
This document defines how the STFC Knowledgebase AI should handle **user-specific queries**, ensuring that responses correctly distinguish between **preloaded game mechanics** and **runtime user input**.  

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Core Principles**  

### **üìå AI Must Not Store User Data**  
- The AI **must not rely on the attached files** to store **user-specific data** (e.g., player level, ship upgrades, officer shards).  
- **All files contain only static game knowledge**, including upgrade costs, efficiency formulas, and cooldown times.  
- If the AI receives a query that requires personal data, it must **prompt the user** instead of assuming values.  

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Query Handling Process**  

### **üü¢ When AI Has Enough Information**  
If a user asks a question that can be answered using **only the game knowledgebase**, the AI should generate a response **immediately**, including:  
‚úÖ **Base costs, mechanics, and upgrade formulas**.  
‚úÖ **Confidence levels and source citations**.  
‚úÖ **Relevant efficiency calculations, if general rules apply**.  

üìå **Example:**  
**User:** *"What are the base resource costs to upgrade an Enterprise D to Tier 12?"*  
**AI Response:**  
*"The base costs to upgrade an Enterprise D from Tier 1 to Tier 12 are:"*  
- **Dilithium:** 50M  
- **Tritanium:** 75M  
- **Uncommon Crystals:** 500  
- **Rare Crystals:** 200  
- **Epic Crystals:** 50  
üîó *Source: Game Mechanics Data (06_Game_Mechanics.json)*  

---

### **üü° When AI Needs More Information**  
If a query **requires user-specific data** (e.g., faction bonuses, research reductions, personal fleet status), the AI must:  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Prompt the user** to provide missing information.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Offer to answer without context** using only generic data.  

üìå **Example:**  
**User:** *"What resources do I need to upgrade my Enterprise D to Tier 12?"*  
**AI Response:**  
*"This depends on your current research efficiencies, faction bonuses, and event discounts. Would you like to:"*  
- *(1) Provide your current research and faction discounts for a personalized answer?*  
- *(2) Proceed with base game values only?*"  

---

### **üî¥ When AI Cannot Answer at All**  
If the AI lacks **both** game data and user input, it should **not attempt to generate an inaccurate response**. Instead, it must:  
‚úÖ **Inform the user why the data is missing**.  
‚úÖ **Suggest how to obtain the necessary information**.  

üìå **Example:**  
**User:** *"How long will it take me to unlock Khan?"*  
**AI Response:**  
*"I can estimate your timeline based on game mechanics, but I need to know your current shard count and acquisition rate. Please provide this information, or I can give a generic estimate based on typical event rewards."*  

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Testing & Validation**  
To ensure compliance with these standards, AI responses must be tested for:  
‚úÖ **Correct differentiation between game data and user data.**  
‚úÖ **Proper prompting when user-specific details are missing.**  
‚úÖ **Accuracy of base values when user input is not provided.**  

üìå **Example Test Case:**  
- **Test Input:** *"How much does it cost to upgrade my Enterprise?"*  
- **Expected AI Behavior:** Prompt for missing **ship type, tier, and user discounts** before answering.  

---

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Conclusion & Next Steps**  
By following this structured approach, the STFC Knowledgebase AI will:  
‚úÖ Provide **accurate, game-based answers** when possible.  
‚úÖ **Prompt users** instead of making assumptions.  
‚úÖ Ensure **testing includes query validation for missing data handling**.  

üöÄ **Next Steps:** Implement testing procedures to verify compliance with these rules.  
```

---

### **Why This Fixes the Issue**
‚úÖ **Clearly defines that user data is NOT stored.**  
‚úÖ **Forces the AI to prompt for missing context.**  
‚úÖ **Ensures testing verifies correct behavior.**  
‚úÖ **Aligns with structured knowledge principles in `02_Data_Storage_Standards.md`.**  

Would you like me to seed another file, or do you want to attach this one first? üöÄ

USER: We can only have 20 files attached at a time. Can I add this to an existing file?

ASSISTANT: Yes! The best place to integrate this would be **`04_User_Interaction_Guide.md`**, since that file already defines **how users should interact with the AI**„Äê30‚Ä†source„Äë.  

---

### **Update `04_User_Interaction_Guide.md` with This Section**
#### **New Section: User Data Handling & Query Responses**  
üìå Add this **at the end** of the existing file:  

```md
---

## **7Ô∏è‚É£ Handling User-Specific Data in Queries**  

### **üìå AI Must Not Store User Data**  
- The AI **does not store or retain** user-specific account data.  
- All files contain **static game knowledge**, including upgrade costs, efficiency formulas, and cooldown times.  
- If a query requires personal data, the AI must **prompt the user** rather than assuming values.  

### **üü° When AI Needs More Information**  
If a query **requires user-specific data** (e.g., faction bonuses, research reductions, fleet status), the AI must:  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Prompt the user** to provide missing information.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Offer to answer using only base game values.**  

üìå **Example:**  
**User:** *"What resources do I need to upgrade my Enterprise D to Tier 12?"*  
**AI Response:**  
*"This depends on your research efficiencies, faction bonuses, and event discounts. Would you like to:"*  
- *(1) Provide your current research and faction discounts for a personalized answer?*  
- *(2) Proceed with base game values only?*"  

### **üî¥ When AI Cannot Answer at All**  
If the AI lacks **both** game data and user input, it must:  
‚úÖ **Explain why the data is missing**.  
‚úÖ **Suggest how to obtain the necessary information**.  

üìå **Example:**  
**User:** *"How long will it take me to unlock Khan?"*  
**AI Response:**  
*"I can estimate your timeline based on game mechanics, but I need to know your current shard count and acquisition rate. Please provide this information, or I can give a generic estimate based on typical event rewards."*  

---

## **8Ô∏è‚É£ Query Handling Validation**  
To ensure compliance, AI responses must be tested for:  
‚úÖ **Correct differentiation between game data and user data.**  
‚úÖ **Proper prompting when user-specific details are missing.**  
‚úÖ **Accuracy of base values when user input is not provided.**  

üìå **Example Test Case:**  
- **Test Input:** *"How much does it cost to upgrade my Enterprise?"*  
- **Expected AI Behavior:** Prompt for missing **ship type, tier, and user discounts** before answering.  

üöÄ **By following this structured approach, the AI ensures accuracy while maintaining a clear separation between game knowledge and user input.**
```

---

### **Why This Works**
‚úÖ **Avoids adding a new file** while keeping the documentation limit intact.  
‚úÖ **Expands an existing file that already deals with user interactions.**  
‚úÖ **Ensures this behavior is documented for testing and validation.**  

Would you like me to modify another file next, or do you want to finalize this update first? üöÄ

USER: Please evaluate all attached documents for logic issues or gaps in processes. Output your findings to this chat.

ASSISTANT: I've reviewed the attached documents for **logic issues, inconsistencies, and process gaps**. Below is a structured **evaluation** of key problems and **recommendations** for fixing them.  

---

## **üõë Critical Issues Found**
These issues **impact core functionality** and should be addressed first.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ No Explicit Rule for Handling Missing Knowledgebase Files**  
- **Problem:** The AI does not have a defined response when **critical knowledge files are missing** (e.g., `06_Game_Mechanics.json`).  
- **Consequence:** The AI may generate **incomplete or incorrect answers** if files are unavailable.  

‚úÖ **Fix:**  
üìå Update `02_Data_Storage_Standards.md` to state:  
  - *"If a required file is missing, the AI must halt processing and request the missing file before continuing."*  
  - *"System Trainers should be alerted when a file is outdated or missing."*  

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ No Conflict Resolution Priority Rules**  
- **Problem:** The **conflict resolution process** (e.g., when two sources provide different ship upgrade costs) is **not well defined**.  
- **Consequence:** The AI may select **inaccurate data** instead of escalating for manual validation.  

‚úÖ **Fix:**  
üìå Update `14_Conflicts_Log.json` to **rank data sources by priority**:  
  - **Highest Trust:** Official Patch Notes  
  - **Medium Trust:** Community Reports (Verified)  
  - **Lowest Trust:** Unverified Data (Flagged for Review)  
  - AI must **always defer to official sources** if conflicts exist.

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ No Testing Process for AI‚Äôs Response Accuracy**  
- **Problem:** While `03_Testing_Quality_Control.md` defines **general** validation, it **does not test AI-generated responses against known correct answers**.  
- **Consequence:** The AI might provide **misleading recommendations** without structured testing.  

‚úÖ **Fix:**  
üìå Update `03_Testing_Quality_Control.md` to require:  
  - **Test Case Creation:** Trainers create **expected responses** for key queries (e.g., ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the best way to upgrade a Saladin?‚Äù).  
  - **AI Response Comparison:** AI-generated answers must be **matched against expected outputs** before approval.  
  - **Failure Logging:** Incorrect responses must be **flagged and retrained**.  

---

## **üü° Moderate Issues Found**
These issues don‚Äôt break functionality but may lead to **poor user experience**.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ No Standard Format for AI Response Confidence Levels**  
- **Problem:** The AI doesn‚Äôt always state **how confident it is** in its answers.  
- **Consequence:** Users **don‚Äôt know** when a response is based on weaker data sources.  

‚úÖ **Fix:**  
üìå Update `04_User_Interaction_Guide.md` to require:  
  - AI must **label every response** with a **confidence rating**:  
    - **High Confidence** (Direct from Official Sources)  
    - **Medium Confidence** (Community Verified)  
    - **Low Confidence** (Unverified Estimate)  

üìå **Example:**  
‚úÖ *"Your Enterprise D upgrade will cost 50M Dilithium (High Confidence: Official Patch Notes, March 2024)."*  
üü° *"Based on community reports, officer drop rates in the last event were 20% (Medium Confidence)."*  

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Missing Economic Analysis for Resource Generation Rates**  
- **Problem:** The AI provides **upgrade costs**, but **does not calculate how long it will take** to earn the required materials.  
- **Consequence:** Players cannot **plan efficiently** without projected timelines.  

‚úÖ **Fix:**  
üìå Update `06_Game_Mechanics.json` with:  
  - **Average Resource Generation Rates** (e.g., Dilithium per hour from refineries/mining).  
  - **Event-Based Earnings** (e.g., how much Tritanium is gained per week from events).  

üìå **Example Query Improvement:**  
- **User:** *‚ÄúHow long will it take me to upgrade my Saladin?‚Äù*  
- **AI (After Fix):** *"With an average gain of 2M Dilithium per day, you‚Äôll need 25 days to gather enough for the upgrade."*  

---

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ No Rules for Prioritizing Officer Crewing Advice**  
- **Problem:** If multiple **crew setups** exist for a ship, the AI **does not define a selection priority**.  
- **Consequence:** Users may receive **suboptimal** recommendations.  

‚úÖ **Fix:**  
üìå Update `06_Game_Mechanics.json` to **prioritize crews by scenario**:  
  - **PvP Meta (Offense & Defense)**  
  - **PvE (Mission & Hostile Grinding)**  
  - **Armadas (Team-Based Content)**  

üìå **Example Query Fix:**  
- **User:** *‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the best crew for a level 50 PvP fight?‚Äù*  
- **AI (After Fix):**  
  - ‚úÖ *"Best Crew (PvP Offense): Gorkon (Captain), Khan, Marcus."*  
  - ‚úÖ *"Best Crew (PvP Defense): Kirk (Captain), Spock, Moreau."*  

---

## **üü¢ Minor Issues Found**
These are small refinements that improve **clarity** and **user experience**.

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ No Clear Definition of "Optimal" in Upgrade Recommendations**  
- **Problem:** The AI sometimes suggests an "optimal" upgrade path **without defining what optimal means** (e.g., fastest? cheapest?).  
- **Consequence:** Users **may misunderstand** recommendations.  

‚úÖ **Fix:**  
üìå Update `04_User_Interaction_Guide.md` to define:  
  - **Fastest Upgrade Path** (High Cost, Low Time)  
  - **Cheapest Upgrade Path** (Low Cost, Long Time)  
  - **Balanced Approach** (Average Cost & Time)  

üìå **Example Query Fix:**  
- **User:** *‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the best way to upgrade my D4?‚Äù*  
- **AI (After Fix):** *"For speed, buy event packs. For cost-efficiency, wait for faction discounts."*  

---

### **8Ô∏è‚É£ No Guidelines for Handling Contradictory Patch Notes**  
- **Problem:** Sometimes, **official patch notes contain conflicting details** (e.g., different refinery rates).  
- **Consequence:** The AI **does not specify how to resolve these contradictions**.  

‚úÖ **Fix:**  
üìå Update `13_System_Updates.json` to:  
  - Require **cross-referencing older patch notes** before overriding values.  
  - AI must **flag potential inconsistencies** for System Trainers before making updates.  

üìå **Example Conflict Resolution Rule:**  
- **If Patch Notes (March 2024) say ‚Äú10% refinery yield‚Äù but April 2024 says ‚Äú12%,‚Äù AI must:**  
  - üü¢ **Use the latest version** but **mention past inconsistencies** in responses.  
  - üü° **Flag the discrepancy for System Trainers to confirm.**  

---

## **Final Recommendations**
### **üöÄ High-Priority Fixes**
‚úÖ **Define a missing file response rule** (`02_Data_Storage_Standards.md`).  
‚úÖ **Set conflict resolution priority rules** (`14_Conflicts_Log.json`).  
‚úÖ **Add a structured AI response accuracy test** (`03_Testing_Quality_Control.md`).  

### **üõ† Medium-Priority Fixes**
‚úÖ **Enforce AI confidence ratings** (`04_User_Interaction_Guide.md`).  
‚úÖ **Integrate resource earning projections** (`06_Game_Mechanics.json`).  
‚úÖ **Define crew selection priorities** (`06_Game_Mechanics.json`).  

### **üìå Low-Priority Fixes**
‚úÖ **Clarify "optimal" upgrade recommendations** (`04_User_Interaction_Guide.md`).  
‚úÖ **Handle contradictory patch notes more effectively** (`13_System_Updates.json`).

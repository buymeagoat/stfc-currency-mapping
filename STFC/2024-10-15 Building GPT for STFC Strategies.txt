# Building GPT for STFC Strategies
Date: 2024-10-15

USER: I want to build a GPT focused on the game star trek fleet command. My goal is to find strategies and to minmax. Does this make sense?

ASSISTANT: 

ASSISTANT: Absolutely, that makes a lot of sense! Building a GPT focused on *Star Trek Fleet Command* can be a powerful tool for enhancing gameplay, especially if your goal is to strategize and min-max (optimize every aspect for maximum efficiency).

Here’s why this approach would be effective:

### 1. **Strategy Optimization:**
   * *Star Trek Fleet Command* has a lot of moving parts, like resource management, ship selection, crew synergies, and mission choices. A GPT model could be trained to provide optimal strategies for different scenarios.
   * You could leverage the model to compare ship builds, recommend which officers to use in various scenarios, and even map out attack or defense strategies based on inputs about your fleet and opponent's fleet.

### 2. **Data Management & Min-Maxing:**
   * To maximize efficiency, the model could help with decision-making based on in-game metrics like resource production rates, upgrade paths, and the opportunity cost of different activities (e.g., upgrading ships vs. bases).
   * It could also calculate the most efficient way to acquire resources, complete missions, or optimize crew combinations based on known statistics and user data.

### 3. **Personal Gameplay Analysis:**
   * By inputting your current resources, ship configurations, and goals, you could use the GPT to recommend a personalized plan of action. It could help decide what to focus on next, whether it's improving mining speed, attacking certain targets, or upgrading specific buildings.

### 4. **Community Knowledge Base:**
   * You could train the model on knowledge from forums, wikis, and guides to give players quick access to hard-to-find information. This would save time by providing direct answers to specific questions like "What's the best officer combination for PvP?" or "How do I defeat a particular armada?"
  
### 5. **Adaptability:**
   * As the game evolves and new updates are released, you could fine-tune the model with the latest data so it remains relevant and helpful. Keeping the model current with patch notes and new content would help it stay a step ahead of more static guides.

### **How You Could Start:**
- **Data Collection**: Gather information from *Star Trek Fleet Command* wikis, community forums, spreadsheets, and personal gameplay data. This will be the basis of your training material.
- **Focus Areas**:
  - **Ships & Officers**: Teach the model about different ships, officer abilities, synergies, and best crew compositions for various tasks.
  - **Missions & Events**: Include details about specific missions, optimal strategies, and common pitfalls.
  - **Resources**: How to farm resources efficiently, manage in-game currencies, and plan upgrades.
  
- **Fine-Tuning**: If you have access to a GPT model, you could fine-tune it on your gathered dataset. This will give the model specific knowledge about game mechanics, rather than relying on generic gaming knowledge.

### **Challenges to Consider:**
- **Constant Updates**: The game receives regular updates, which means your model will need periodic retraining to remain accurate.
- **Complex Strategies**: Some strategies in *Star Trek Fleet Command* are community-driven and evolve over time. Ensuring your model keeps up with these dynamic elements may require active community engagement.

This project could be really rewarding if you enjoy diving deep into games and analyzing all the details. It would not only help you but could also be valuable for others in the community who are striving to master the game.

USER: Here are a few things I want to achieve:

1) Find officer combinations for particular situations that optimize killing the hostiles, gathering loot, and reduce the amount of time I'm grinding.
2) Figure out how many currencies I need to gather for that various aspects of the game so I can keep up with doing pulls in order to advance my game.

Do you have questions about either of these?

ASSISTANT: It sounds like you have two very focused goals, and I definitely have a few questions that could help make sure I give you the most helpful guidance possible for each of these.

### 1. Finding Officer Combinations for Specific Situations:
- **Officer Data**: Do you have a source for officer abilities, stats, synergies, and how they impact ship performance? Are these sources community-generated spreadsheets or official game resources?
- **Situational Criteria**: How would you like to define specific situations? For example:
  - Are you looking at particular types of hostiles (e.g., faction-specific or levels)?
  - Are there different types of loot you'd like to prioritize, or would you prefer a focus on reducing damage to ships to reduce grinding costs (repairs)?
  - Would you want the model to optimize for efficiency overall, or focus more on a specific aspect like energy savings, fastest grinding, or maximum loot yield?

### 2. Figuring Out Currency Requirements for Game Advancement:
- **Currencies and Sources**: There are various in-game currencies like latinum, faction credits, recruit tokens, materials, and resources (tritanium, dilithium, etc.). Could you provide a list of the main ones you want to track or focus on?
- **Pull Planning**: Are you more interested in planning pulls for specific ships/officers or keeping a more general overview of resource costs for upgrades (e.g., building, research, ships)? This affects how specific the currency breakdown needs to be.
- **Desired Frequency**: Are you interested in daily/weekly goals for gathering these resources? Or would you prefer a more long-term overview that helps you plan for major game milestones?

Once I understand these details better, I can suggest ways to structure the data inputs and outputs to give you practical and actionable advice tailored to your goals. Let me know if you can clarify any of these!

USER: Do you have data about what particular officers do or do I need to provide that?

ASSISTANT: I don't have the data for specific officers and their abilities in *Star Trek Fleet Command* built into my model, as that information tends to be game-specific and changes frequently with updates. However, if you provide me with data about the officers—such as their names, abilities, stats, and any special synergies—they have, I can help build strategies and optimize combinations based on that information.

You could gather the data from sources like:
- Community spreadsheets that often get updated with new officers and their stats.
- Game wikis and guides, which may have detailed breakdowns of each officer's strengths, weaknesses, and situational uses.
- Your personal experience or screenshots from the game.

Once I have that data, I can help create the logic to match officers to specific scenarios, optimizing for killing hostiles, reducing grind time, and gathering loot. If you have data in a structured form (e.g., tables or spreadsheets), that would be especially helpful, as it would allow me to process it more efficiently to assist you with strategic recommendations.

USER: I can find all sorts of resources and paste them in here to help train you. Is that the best approach?

ASSISTANT: Pasting information directly into this chat would be helpful for building strategies on-the-fly, but it wouldn't really train me in the sense of making me permanently learn and retain it over sessions (like a fine-tuned model would). Instead, we can use any data you provide in the current session to generate the optimal officer combinations or strategies you're seeking, but the data wouldn't be retained between sessions without saving it in some external format.

Here are a few approaches we could consider:

### 1. **Real-Time Assistance:**
   - You could paste in officer data and relevant game stats whenever you need specific strategic advice.
   - I could use the information you provide to generate recommendations for that session—like which officers to use in a specific battle or the best way to use resources for upgrades.
   - This approach is convenient if you only need occasional help and don't mind sharing data each time.

### 2. **Creating a Structured Knowledge Base:**
   - You could compile officer data and game details into a structured document (like a Google Sheets or Excel spreadsheet).
   - During a session, you could share that data, and I can help you make decisions based on it.
   - This would allow for more consistent advice and might be easier to manage than manually copying and pasting each time.

### 3. **Custom GPT Model or Application:**
   - If you want a more persistent solution that "remembers" everything about *Star Trek Fleet Command*:
     - **Fine-Tuning**: You could train a custom GPT model on your compiled officer data and game resources. This would involve using an OpenAI API or similar to fine-tune a GPT-3 or GPT-4 model using your datasets. This trained model would then "know" all the specific game details.
     - **Custom Bot Application**: You could use a framework like Rasa or a chatbot environment with a GPT-powered backend to make a persistent Star Trek Fleet Command assistant. You'd feed it a dataset once, and it would use that knowledge for ongoing assistance.

### 4. **Combining Tools for the Best of Both Worlds:**
   - **Database or Spreadsheet Integration**: We could make use of a tool or integration between something like Google Sheets and a chatbot framework. You could use a spreadsheet to store data on officers, ships, resources, and the chatbot (integrated with GPT) could draw from it as needed. This way, you could keep updating a single file, and I could reference it without needing to re-enter everything each time.

If you're looking for something more automated and persistent, approaches 3 or 4 are the way to go, though they require a bit more setup and access to development tools. If you're fine with providing data as needed, option 1 or 2 is a simpler and more immediate way to get started.

Let me know which approach you’d prefer, and I can guide you further based on that!

USER: Let's make a custom GPT for this. Can you help me?

ASSISTANT: Tony wants to build a custom GPT focused on the game Star Trek Fleet Command to help find strategies and optimize gameplay through min-maxing.

ASSISTANT: That sounds like an exciting project! Building a custom GPT focused on *Star Trek Fleet Command* will allow you to optimize gameplay and help others in the community too. Here’s how I can help you step-by-step:

### **Step 1: Gathering and Organizing Data**
- **Officer Details**: You’ll need a dataset with all officer names, abilities, specializations, and any synergy they provide. You can gather this from community sources, wikis, or create a custom spreadsheet.
- **Game Mechanics**: Include details like ships, mission requirements, currencies, building levels, and any aspect of the game that would be beneficial to strategize.
- **Structured Format**: Ideally, collect this data in a structured format like CSV or JSON. This helps during the model fine-tuning phase since structured data is easier to work with.

**Action Item**: Start collecting data on officers, abilities, game currencies, and game scenarios that are important for optimization.

### **Step 2: Data Preparation and Preprocessing**
- **Data Cleaning**: Make sure that the data is consistent, with no missing values or errors. For example, officer abilities should be clearly defined in terms of impact, duration, synergies, etc.
- **Labeling and Categorization**: Create labels for different types of officers (e.g., “Mining Specialist,” “PvP Specialist”) and game scenarios (e.g., “Hostile Grinding,” “Resource Gathering”).

**Action Item**: Prepare the data for training. Clean up inconsistencies and organize it logically.

### **Step 3: Choosing the Training Method**
You have a few options for how you want to train the model:
- **Fine-Tuning GPT-3/GPT-4**: You could use OpenAI’s API to fine-tune an existing model with the specific data you gathered. This will allow the model to “learn” the specifics of *Star Trek Fleet Command*. You would need to prepare a set of prompts and expected responses based on your collected data.
- **Training a Smaller Model**: If you’re comfortable with machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, you could also consider training a smaller model from scratch or using an open-source language model as a base.

**Action Item**: Decide if you want to fine-tune an existing model using OpenAI’s API or train a smaller open-source model. I recommend fine-tuning GPT-3/GPT-4 for better performance and ease.

### **Step 4: Fine-Tuning the Model**
- **Create Prompts and Responses**: Use your data to create question-and-answer pairs that the model will learn from. For example, a question might be, “What’s the best officer combination for grinding level 40 hostiles?” and the answer would include an optimal crew setup.
- **Use OpenAI’s API**: You’ll need to create an OpenAI account, and there are fees for fine-tuning. You can upload your dataset and begin training the model with your specific prompts and responses.

**Action Item**: Prepare sample questions and answers. These should represent the type of queries you’ll ask the model in-game, and how the model should respond.

### **Step 5: Testing and Iteration**
- **Test the Model**: After fine-tuning, you’ll want to test the model to see how well it provides useful strategies. Feed it various scenarios from the game and compare the results to your own strategies.
- **Improve the Dataset**: Identify areas where the model isn’t providing useful advice and refine the training dataset accordingly. Iterative improvement is key to making the model helpful.

**Action Item**: Run a series of test prompts to see how well the model is trained and identify areas where more examples or better data are needed.

### **Step 6: Deployment (Optional)**
- **Building an Interface**: If you want to share the model or make it more user-friendly, you could build an interface for it. This might be a web-based chatbot or an app where users can input game information and get recommendations.
- **Hosting the Model**: If you want to make the model accessible online, you’ll need to host it on a server or cloud provider.

**Action Item**: Consider whether you’d like the model to be deployed for public use or kept as a personal tool.

### **Tools You’ll Need:**
- **Data Collection**: Google Sheets or Excel for gathering and organizing game information.
- **Fine-Tuning**: OpenAI’s API for fine-tuning the GPT model.
- **Code Development**: Python for interacting with the API and preparing the dataset.
- **Deployment (Optional)**: Flask/Django for a web interface, and a hosting service like Heroku or AWS if you want others to use the model.

Let me know if you want to proceed with a particular step or if you'd like more detailed help on any part of this plan! I'm here to help guide you through the process.

USER: Is there a way to do this without spending money beyond the $20 per month for chatgpt premium?

ASSISTANT: 

ASSISTANT: Yes, there are a few options for developing a custom GPT model focused on *Star Trek Fleet Command* without spending additional money beyond the ChatGPT Plus subscription. While you won't have the same capability to train a model in the sense of traditional fine-tuning, there are still effective ways to achieve your goal using existing tools and some creative approaches. Here are some ideas:

### 1. **Utilize Custom Instructions with ChatGPT Plus**
With your Plus subscription, you can make use of **Custom Instructions** to help tailor responses based on what you're working on:
- Add specific information about *Star Trek Fleet Command* officers, synergies, and other key data into the "What would you like ChatGPT to know about you to provide better responses?" section.
- Each time you interact with me, I can build on this context to give you detailed recommendations.
  
While this won’t create a model that retains information permanently across all sessions, it allows you to set up the groundwork for effective back-and-forth discussions without having to repeat everything every time.

### 2. **Leverage Google Sheets Integration (Manual Data Reference)**
Instead of fully training a custom model, you could use Google Sheets to store all your officer data, ship stats, and relevant in-game resources:
- You can share the data manually each time, which would allow me to assist you with specific strategies by referencing the details you provide.
- You could maintain this information in Google Sheets, and when needed, copy-paste relevant portions into our conversation.
  
This approach would effectively let me make use of the data to provide custom recommendations without additional costs.

### 3. **Use Free Open-Source Tools for Lightweight Solutions**
If you want to create a semi-automated experience, you could explore **free open-source language models** that can be fine-tuned locally:
- **LLama 2**, **GPT-J**, or other smaller open-source models can be downloaded and hosted on your own machine for no cost. The hardware requirement might be higher, but it’s possible to use smaller models that run on consumer-grade hardware.
- Using a tool like **GPT4All** (which can help with local model hosting and setup) could also be an option. These are not as sophisticated as OpenAI’s models, but they can still handle basic question-answer setups if trained well enough.

### 4. **Memory Feature with ChatGPT 4 Turbo (When Available)**
When the memory feature becomes available with ChatGPT (expected soon in your Plus subscription), you’ll be able to store information permanently across sessions, which is exactly what you'd need to build a semi-permanent “knowledge base” about *Star Trek Fleet Command*. You could input all officer abilities, resource management details, etc., and I could reference them at any point.
- **Memory Use**: Store officer stats, ship attributes, synergies, etc., and I would be able to recall these details whenever needed.
- This would give you the benefits of persistent customization, allowing us to build on strategies each time you return.

### 5. **Manual Fine-Tuning with a Framework**
- Use a local development framework such as **LangChain** or **Rasa**. These tools can be integrated with an existing language model API (like OpenAI’s API), and you can simulate a custom GPT by feeding it extensive prompt chains.
- Instead of true model fine-tuning, you’re essentially crafting a series of prompt templates to give a more focused and relevant response based on your pre-written data.

### 6. **Free Online Hosted Tools (like Colab for Python)**
- **Google Colab** allows you to run Python notebooks for free, including basic AI models.
- You could create a lightweight program using Python and freely available AI models (like BERT-based Q&A models) that pull information from your pre-collected data in Google Sheets or CSV files. You would use Colab’s free environment to create an interactive notebook to answer your queries.

### **Suggested Path Forward**
1. **Set Up Custom Instructions**:
   - Add key *Star Trek Fleet Command* details to the custom instructions. This will help tailor my responses for every session.
2. **Use Google Sheets to Organize Data**:
   - Keep detailed game data in Google Sheets so that it’s easy to copy-paste into our sessions.
3. **Utilize the Memory Feature (When Available)**:
   - When the memory feature becomes available for ChatGPT Plus, use it to store persistent game details, strategies, and personal preferences for ongoing optimization.
  
These approaches are entirely within the scope of your existing $20/month subscription and will give you a lot of flexibility and power for optimizing your gameplay without incurring extra costs. Let me know which of these paths feels right to you, and we can dive deeper into setting it up!

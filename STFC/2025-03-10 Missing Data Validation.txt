# Missing Data Validation
Date: 2025-03-10

USER: Verify this GPT will operate how the instructions indicate it will operate.

ASSISTANT: Your uploaded files are valid JSON structures, but they are all empty. This means:

1. **No currencies are defined** in `currencies_core.json`.
2. **No sources or sinks** exist in `currency_sources.json` and `currency_spending.json`, making tracking impossible.
3. **No conversions, relationships, or modifiers** are present, meaning the economy isn't mapped.
4. **No historical data** exists to track changes over time.
5. **No endpoints** are listed, so currency interactions within the game are undefined.

### How the GPT Will Operate
- It will **recognize missing data** and alert you.
- It will **require you to provide new currency data** before proceeding.
- It will **not modify files directly** but will provide **step-by-step update instructions**.
- It will **ensure JSON structure correctness** before proceeding with recommendations.
- If economic relationships, conversions, or dependencies are unclear, it will **suggest inferred relationships**.

### Next Steps
Would you like to **start defining currencies**, or do you need assistance with populating any specific section?

ASSISTANT: The files you uploaded appear to be in the correct format, but they are all empty or have minimal content. To ensure the GPT operates according to the provided instructions, the files should contain structured data that maps currencies, their sources, spending, relationships, conversions, etc.

Here is a summary of your files:

- **currency_endpoints.json**: Empty object for `endpoints`.
- **currency_relationships.json**: Empty object for `relationships`.
- **currency_modifiers.json**: Empty object for `modifiers`.
- **currency_spending.json**: Empty object for `spending`.
- **currency_sources.json**: Empty object for `sources`.
- **currencies_core.json**: Empty object for `currencies`.
- **currency_conversions.json**: Empty object for `conversions`.
- **historical_changes.json**: Empty object for `history`.

The GPT will follow the structure and validate data once it's populated with the necessary information. If you want to proceed with building out the currency structure, feel free to add data into these files, and I can guide you through the process step by step.

Would you like to start defining or updating currencies or any other aspects of your economic mapping?

USER: What if I just give you a currency with no context? How will you know it's a currency?


ASSISTANT: If you give me a currency name without context, I will use the following steps to determine if it is likely a currency within **Star Trek Fleet Command (STFC)**:

1. **Check Against `currencies_core.json`**  
   - If the currency already exists in the uploaded file, I will confirm its presence.
   - If not, I will flag it as a **potentially new currency**.

2. **Compare with Known STFC Naming Conventions**  
   - Many STFC currencies follow recognizable patterns (e.g., "Ultra Recruit Tokens," "Faction Credits," "Isogen," etc.).
   - If the name fits STFC economic structures, I will assume it is a currency.

3. **Cross-Check with `currency_sources.json` and `currency_spending.json`**  
   - If I find evidence that this currency is obtained or spent in these files, I will confirm it as a currency.

4. **Detect Similarity to Existing Currency Structures**  
   - If the name resembles known economic endpoints (officers, research, buildings, etc.), I will ask for clarification.

5. **Ask You for Confirmation**  
   - If a currency is completely unknown or ambiguous, I will request more details (e.g., **"How is this obtained or spent?"**).

Would you like to test this by providing a currency name now?

USER: sigma general speedup 1 minute

ASSISTANT: Let's analyze **"Sigma General Speedup 1 Minute"** using the verification steps:

1. **Check `currencies_core.json`**  
   - Your `currencies_core.json` is empty, so I **cannot confirm** this as a known currency in your existing data.

2. **Compare with Known STFC Naming Conventions**  
   - "Speedup" items in STFC are typically consumable resources used to accelerate timers (builds, repairs, research, etc.).
   - The prefix **"Sigma"** suggests a specific event, faction, or store-related variation.

3. **Cross-Check with `currency_sources.json` and `currency_spending.json`**  
   - Both files are empty, meaning I cannot verify acquisition or spending.
   - However, based on STFC conventions, **speedups are usually obtained from events, daily goals, or purchases** and spent to reduce timers.

4. **Detect Similarity to Existing Structures**  
   - Speedups are often **categorized as resources rather than traditional currencies**. However, if you are tracking them as currencies, I can include them.

5. **Ask for Confirmation**  
   - **Question for you:** Do you want speedups to be treated as currencies, or should they be considered a separate category of consumables?

If you want to track them as currencies, I can add **"Sigma General Speedup 1 Minute"** to `currencies_core.json` and suggest updates to `currency_sources.json` and `currency_spending.json`. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!

USER: That's a great question. I suppose they aren't a currency but rather an endpoint of a currency. You can obtain them through various means, including armada redemptions and such, So maybe we classify speed ups as an endpoint. I don't currently know if it somehow affects other currency redemptions, though.

ASSISTANT: That makes sense! **Speedups are an endpoint**, meaning they are **obtained through currency interactions but do not function as a currency themselves**.

### What We Should Do:
1. **Add "Sigma General Speedup 1 Minute" to `currency_endpoints.json`**
   - Since speedups are an endpoint, they should be tracked there.
   
2. **Define How Speedups Are Acquired in `currency_sources.json`**
   - If they come from **Armada redemptions, events, stores, etc.**, we should list those.

3. **Determine If Speedups Affect Any Currencies**
   - If a player **redeems a speedup pack using a currency** (like "Sigma Credits"), that would establish a relationship in `currency_relationships.json`.
   - If a speedup **reduces timers that influence currency production** (e.g., research that boosts resources), we may need to track **modifiers**.

### Next Steps:
1. **Confirm How You Want to Classify Speedups in `currency_endpoints.json`**
   - Should I categorize them under **"Consumables"** or **a different label**?
  
2. **Identify a Currency That Can Be Used to Obtain Them**
   - Do you know of any currency (e.g., Sigma Credits, Armada Credits) that can be spent to acquire speedups?

Let me know, and I’ll draft the necessary JSON updates!

USER: Consumables is great. 

I don't precisely know how to get them so let's just skip that.

ASSISTANT: Got it! We'll classify **"Sigma General Speedup 1 Minute"** as a **Consumable** in `currency_endpoints.json` and skip defining its acquisition source for now.

### **JSON Update for `currency_endpoints.json`**
I will add the following entry:

```json
{
  "endpoints": [
    {
      "name": "Sigma General Speedup 1 Minute",
      "type": "Consumable",
      "description": "Reduces time on construction, research, and other timers.",
      "related_currencies": []
    }
  ]
}
```

This:
✅ **Categorizes the speedup as a consumable**  
✅ **Leaves the related currency field empty** (since we don’t know yet)  
✅ **Keeps the description functional and game-accurate**  

Would you like me to generate JSON update steps, or do you want to apply this manually?

USER: What if I give you several currencies at once?

Uncommon Uranium
Rare Uranium
Epic Uranium
Stella Particle
Diplomacy Token
Outlaw Research Credits
Bajoran Badge
Gamma Particle
Apex Research Medal

ASSISTANT: Great! I'll now go through each of these and classify them properly.  

### **Step 1: Identify Each Entry**
I'll determine if each is a currency or belongs in another category (e.g., an endpoint).

#### **Likely Currencies (To be added to `currencies_core.json`)**  
1. **Uncommon Uranium**  
2. **Rare Uranium**  
3. **Epic Uranium**  
   - Uranium is likely a tiered resource used for upgrades, research, or purchases.  
   
4. **Diplomacy Token**  
   - Likely used in a faction-based store or for specific transactions.  

5. **Outlaw Research Credits**  
   - Likely a currency for Outlaw-themed research unlocks.  

6. **Bajoran Badge**  
   - May function as a currency in the Bajoran faction store.  

7. **Apex Research Medal**  
   - Likely tied to the Apex events and research progression.  

#### **Likely Endpoints (To be added to `currency_endpoints.json`)**  
8. **Stella Particle**  
   - Likely a consumable used for **Stella upgrades or ship modifications**.  

9. **Gamma Particle**  
   - Likely a **research or ship upgrade material**, not a direct currency.  

### **Step 2: JSON Updates**
I'll generate **two separate updates**:  
1. Adding the **currencies** to `currencies_core.json`.  
2. Adding the **endpoints** to `currency_endpoints.json`.  

Would you like me to provide these updates in a step-by-step format for manual entry, or just display the full JSON modifications for you to apply?

USER: What happens if you miscategorize a currency's function?

ASSISTANT: If I **misclassify** a currency (e.g., labeling a currency as an endpoint or vice versa), it can lead to **inaccurate economic mapping**, which can cause issues like:

### **Potential Problems from Misclassification**
1. **Broken Tracking**  
   - If a currency is mistakenly classified as an endpoint, it won't appear in `currency_sources.json` or `currency_spending.json`, making it **impossible to track how it's obtained or spent**.

2. **Incorrect Relationships**  
   - If an item is actually a currency but marked as an endpoint, we might **miss key conversions or interactions** with other currencies.

3. **Errors in Spending and Sourcing Data**  
   - If something should be **spent like a currency**, but we treat it as a **final reward (endpoint)**, the economic flow will be incorrect.

### **How We Fix It**
1. **Detecting Issues**  
   - If you notice a misclassification, I can **correct it** by updating the relevant JSON files.  
   - If I notice inconsistencies while mapping spending and sources, I’ll **flag them for review**.

2. **Reassigning the Entry**  
   - If something is an endpoint but should be a currency, I'll **move it to `currencies_core.json`** and update its sources/spending data.  
   - If something is a currency but is better tracked as an endpoint, I’ll **relocate it to `currency_endpoints.json`**.

3. **Updating Related Files**  
   - If a reclassification affects other files (e.g., `currency_relationships.json` or `currency_conversions.json`), I’ll guide you through the necessary corrections.

Would you like to proceed with adding the **Uranium tiers, Diplomacy Token, Bajoran Badge, etc., as currencies** while keeping **Stella Particle and Gamma Particle as endpoints**, or would you like to double-check any classification before proceeding?

USER: It sounds like we need to do just a couple at a time to ensure accuracy. What if I created a text file of every currency about which I know and attached it to the GPT? You could then compare that list against what we've already processed. We can pick up on the list at any time. 

ASSISTANT: That’s a great approach! If you create a text file listing all the currencies you know about, I can:

1. **Compare your list with `currencies_core.json`** to find:
   - Missing currencies that need to be added.
   - Existing ones that match.
   - Potential misclassified items.

2. **Track Progress**  
   - We can check off processed currencies as we go, ensuring we don’t duplicate efforts.
   - We can resume at any point without losing track of what’s been done.

3. **Validate Accuracy**  
   - This will let us carefully categorize each currency **without rushing** and ensure that related data (spending, sources, endpoints) is mapped correctly.

### **Next Steps**
- **Create and upload** a text file listing every currency you know.  
- I will **compare it against your existing `currencies_core.json`** and report any gaps.  
- We’ll process small batches for accuracy.  

Once you’re ready, upload the file, and we’ll get started!

USER: This will contain a whole bunch of data, not just currencies, Some will be endpoints. We'll need to figure all that out. What would you like me to name the file for clarity purposes?

ASSISTANT: Great! Since the file will contain **both currencies and endpoints**, let's name it something clear. Here are a few options:

1. **`stfc_economy_master_list.txt`** – Covers all economic elements, not just currencies.  
2. **`stfc_currencies_and_endpoints.txt`** – Specifically mentions currencies and endpoints.  
3. **`stfc_economy_data.txt`** – Generic but still clear.  

I recommend **`stfc_economy_master_list.txt`** since it keeps things broad enough while signaling that it includes **currencies, endpoints, and potentially other economic factors**.  

Once you upload the file, I’ll:
- **Cross-check it with your existing JSON files.**  
- **Classify each entry into the correct category.**  
- **Highlight missing data and potential issues.**  

Let me know when you're ready!

USER: I've attached a currency file. Please scan it and give me your thoughts.

ASSISTANT: Please wait while I process the file and compare its contents against your existing JSON data. I'll determine which entries are **currencies, endpoints, or possibly something else**, then provide recommendations.

ASSISTANT: I need you to upload the file again. I don't see it in the current session. Once you attach it, I'll scan and compare it with the existing JSON data.

USER: show me which files are attached to this GPT.

ASSISTANT: Here are the files currently attached to this session:

1. **currencies_core.json** – Contains defined currencies.  
2. **currency_sources.json** – Maps how currencies are acquired.  
3. **currency_spending.json** – Tracks where currencies are spent.  
4. **currency_conversions.json** – Documents conversion rates.  
5. **currency_relationships.json** – Defines links between different currencies.  
6. **currency_endpoints.json** – Lists where currencies interact in the game economy.  
7. **currency_modifiers.json** – Details influencing factors (e.g., bonuses, penalties).  
8. **historical_changes.json** – Logs economic shifts over time.  

Your **master currency list file is not attached** yet. Please upload it, and I'll analyze it right away!

USER: How can I get this session to see the newly attached file without starting a new chat session?

ASSISTANT: You can simply **upload the file again** in this chat session. Once you upload it, I will be able to access and process it immediately.  

No need to start a new session—just click the **paperclip/upload button**, select your file, and send it over. I'll scan it and compare it with your existing JSON data.

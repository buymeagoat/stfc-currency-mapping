# STFC AI Testing Guide

USER: How should we start testing you?

ASSISTANT: To start testing the STFC Knowledgebase AI, follow this structured approach:

### **1️⃣ Phase 1: Internal Knowledge Validation**
✅ **Ask specific game-related questions** to check if responses align with the structured knowledgebase.
✅ **Verify AI-generated responses** against existing data in files such as:
   - `06_Game_Mechanics.json` (for mechanics, ship stats, officer abilities).
   - `07_Faction_Stores.json` (for faction store inventories, costs, and timers).
   - `08_Game_Events.json` (for recurring events, milestones, rewards).
✅ **Check AI’s response structure**, ensuring:
   - It provides clear, step-by-step breakdowns.
   - It cites sources correctly.
   - It includes confidence levels.

🚀 **Example Test Queries:**
- *"What is the best ship for level 40 PvP?"*
- *"How do I optimize officer shard collection for Officer X?"*
- *"What refinery option is most efficient for G4 materials?"*

---

### **2️⃣ Phase 2: Edge Case & Conflict Testing**
✅ **Ask conflicting or outdated questions** to test AI’s ability to handle discrepancies.
✅ **Test AI’s response when key files are missing** (e.g., temporarily remove `07_Faction_Stores.json` and see how it handles missing data).
✅ **Check if AI correctly flags uncertainties**, prompting for clarifications instead of assuming answers.

🚨 **Example Edge Case Queries:**
- *"How many shards does Event Y give?"* (when the data is missing or outdated)
- *"What is the drop rate for rare blueprints?"* (when conflicting sources exist)
- *"What happens if I promote Officer X without enough XP?"* (testing missing logic)

---

### **3️⃣ Phase 3: Performance & Stress Testing**
✅ **Simulate high query volume** by rapidly asking multiple game-related questions.
✅ **Evaluate response speed and accuracy under load.**
✅ **Check session storage** (does AI retain temporary user data properly?).

🔹 **Metrics to Track:**
- Response time under normal and high query volume.
- Percentage of correctly structured responses.
- Rate of flagged errors or inconsistencies.

---

### **4️⃣ Phase 4: Live User Testing & Feedback**
✅ **Allow end users to test AI queries** and provide structured feedback.
✅ **Monitor flagged inaccuracies** and adjust knowledgebase entries as needed.
✅ **Ensure knowledge updates are smoothly integrated** without introducing new issues.

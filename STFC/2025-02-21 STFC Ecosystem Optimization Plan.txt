# STFC Ecosystem Optimization Plan
Date: 2025-02-21

USER: Do you understand what you need to do?

ASSISTANT: Yes, I understand what needs to be done.

Your STFC GPT Ecosystem consists of three GPT components‚Äî**STFC Data Architect (STFCDA), STFC Knowledge Extractor (STFCKE), and STFC Witness (STFCW)**‚Äîeach with defined roles and interdependencies. You, as the **User Architect**, serve as the final decision-maker, ensuring all systems remain aligned with the long-term goal of **merging STFCKE into STFCDA** once formula validation reaches a high confidence level.

### Immediate Tasks:
1. **Ensure System Integrity**
   - Validate that all components are operating according to their roles as outlined in the **System Design Document (v1.0)**„Äê21‚Ä†source„Äë.
   - Confirm that all recent instruction updates across STFCDA, STFCKE, and STFCW remain **consistent and complementary**„Äê32‚Ä†source„Äë.
   - Conduct a **metadata alignment check** to ensure inter-GPT communication remains synchronized„Äê34‚Ä†source„Äë.

2. **Refine Formula & Efficiency Calculations**
   - Ensure **upgrade cost formulas** and **efficiency calculations** correctly incorporate cooldown times, faction store claims, refinery pulls, and other economic mechanisms„Äê22‚Ä†source„Äë.
   - Implement **customizable resource harvesting playstyles** (Basic, Advanced, Expert) for STFCDA„Äê34‚Ä†source„Äë.

3. **Streamline Data Processing & Confidence Validation**
   - STFCKE's **Transcript Processing Protocol v1.1** should be fully leveraged to ensure the **structured extraction of in-game economic data**„Äê31‚Ä†source„Äë.
   - Cross-GPT workflows need to be **audited** to ensure STFCKE‚Äôs **soft data ingestion aligns with STFCDA‚Äôs validation framework**„Äê33‚Ä†source„Äë.

4. **Implement a Systematic File Sharing & Knowledge Management Plan**
   - A process needs to be established where files generated by GPTs are systematically **uploaded, tracked, and shared among components**„Äê34‚Ä†source„Äë.
   - Define **clear triggers** for exporting validation results and reconciliation reports between STFCDA, STFCKE, and STFCW„Äê26‚Ä†source„Äë„Äê36‚Ä†source„Äë.

5. **Assess Readiness for Convergence**
   - STFCW needs to **evaluate and quantify** how close STFCKE is to being absorbed into STFCDA„Äê33‚Ä†source„Äë.
   - This includes metrics such as:
     - **Number of STFCKE submissions that did not require formula adjustments**.
     - **Percentage of STFCKE data aligning with existing STFCDA models**„Äê35‚Ä†source„Äë.
     - **Reduction in novel soft data contributions over time**.

### Next Steps:
- **Would you like me to generate a structured checklist** to track the progress of these tasks?
- **Should I prioritize automation suggestions** to further reduce manual intervention in your workflow?

Let me know how you‚Äôd like to proceed! üöÄ

USER: It doesn't seem you know what needs to be done. What needs to be done is you take the information I've provided, find the high level concepts, the things I've asked you to do in the conversations, potentially connectable information, and behavioral aspects from these files and build a high level understanding of the system associated with these documents. Do not assume this is how it must be constructed. This is just one method. Maybe you look at all this determine we are going about it the wrong way or there's additional information we need before we can even understand what we are trying to accomplish. An expert with this mindset wouldn't just take what I give it and say, "Yeah, we'll just do this". An expert would advisor try to find what's actually desired through the noise of all the information I've provided. 

If this isn't clear in the gpt's instructions, then let's write out new instructions to that end. This GPT's goal is to be a system's design expert with a focus on knowledgebase implementation and management. The end project, as I understand it, is that I want a one-stop-shop for Star Trek Fleet Command players to ask questions about the game and get reliable answers based on the knowledge base we've constructed from a multitude of different sources. First and foremost, you need to come at this as a system's expert and second as someone who is going to help it meet the needs of the end user.

ASSISTANT: You're right to challenge the approach‚ÄîI was operating within the predefined structure rather than questioning whether it's the right structure to begin with. Let's step back and take a **true systems design** approach, which means we need to define the **actual problem**, assess **what we know vs. what we don‚Äôt**, and ensure that the **implementation aligns with the real goal** rather than just iterating on the existing framework.

---

## **High-Level Understanding of the System**
### **Ultimate Goal (As Stated & Implied)**
- **A knowledge base that serves as a one-stop-shop for Star Trek Fleet Command (STFC) players**.
- **The knowledge base must be reliable, sourced from multiple data points**, and structured to provide **authoritative, verifiable answers**.
- It should **ingest and validate disparate data sources**, resolving contradictions.
- It should be **future-proof**, adapting as the game updates.

### **Current Approach (As Extracted from Documents)**
The current system is structured as a **multi-GPT knowledge processing pipeline**:
1. **STFC Knowledge Extractor (STFCKE)** collects **soft data** (community insights, player reports, transcripts).
2. **STFC Data Architect (STFCDA)** is the **master validator** that refines formulas, integrates structured economic data, and aims to phase out STFCKE once confidence is high.
3. **STFC Witness (STFCW)** serves as an **auditor**, ensuring integrity between data sources and maintaining consistency.
4. **User Architect (You)** manages system-level decisions, data flow, and convergence oversight.

---

## **Critical Analysis of the Current Approach**
### **1. Are We Solving the Right Problem?**
- This approach is **built around validating numerical data**, with a focus on game economy formulas and structured efficiency modeling.
- However, **most players won‚Äôt ask about formulas directly**‚Äîthey‚Äôll ask **gameplay questions**:
  - *"What‚Äôs the best crew for this hostile?"*
  - *"How do I progress efficiently?"*
  - *"Where can I get officer shards?"*
- A **numbers-first approach** may lead to a **gap between what we validate** and **what players actually want to know**.

**üîπ Possible Oversight:**  
We may need to **broaden the validation model** beyond just numerical consistency and include structured knowledge validation for **guides, sourcing methods, and best practices**.

---

### **2. Are We Using the Right Architecture?**
#### **Strengths**
‚úÖ The structured pipeline (KE ‚Üí DA ‚Üí Witness) is great for handling **economic calculations** and structured data validation.  
‚úÖ The phased-out **STFCKE model ensures efficiency over time**, avoiding redundancy.  
‚úÖ The system has **metadata versioning, confidence levels, and reconciliation mechanisms**, which are critical for tracking changes over time.

#### **Weaknesses**
‚ùå **Rigid processing structure:** Everything depends on STFCKE being **temporary**, but what if ‚Äúsoft data‚Äù never stops being valuable? Players will **always** generate new insights, tactics, and discussions that won‚Äôt fit neatly into formulas.  
‚ùå **Limited support for non-numeric knowledge:** Guides, strategy advice, and evolving gameplay best practices may not be handled well within the existing validation pipeline.  
‚ùå **Potentially slow iteration cycle:** The feedback loops between the GPTs are built for structured data validation, but **player knowledge changes daily**‚Äîwe might need **real-time adaptability** rather than an audit-driven process.

**üîπ Possible Redesign Considerations:**  
- Keep STFCKE **permanently**, but make it a **real-time updater of player strategies**, distinct from economic validation.  
- Shift STFCDA into a **dual-layer system**:  
  1. **Hard Data Processing Layer** (formulas, efficiencies, upgrade costs).  
  2. **Dynamic Knowledge Layer** (curated, evolving player insights).  
- Introduce a **"Trusted Sources" system** for gameplay advice, similar to how confidence levels exist for economic data.

---

### **3. What Are We Missing?**
üîé **What Data Are We Not Capturing Yet?**  
- We haven‚Äôt formalized **officer synergies, combat strategies, ship crew loadouts, or PvP tactics** in a structured format.
- The system doesn‚Äôt yet **automate tracking of changes in patch updates**, player discoveries, or developer announcements.

üîé **How Should Players Access This?**  
- Right now, we are **focused on backend validation**‚Äîbut what‚Äôs the **user interface**?  
- Will this be a **website, a Discord bot, an in-game plugin, or a knowledge-base GPT**?

üîé **What About Data Aging?**  
- Older knowledge might need **time-sensitive expiration rules** (e.g., crew meta shifts every 6 months).
- Do we need an **auto-archive feature** for outdated insights?

---

## **New Instructions for the GPT (If We Need to Adjust Its Role)**
If we are **redesigning** this as a true **system architecture expert**, we need new GPT behavior rules:

### **GPT Instructions Rewrite:**
üìå **Purpose:**  
This GPT is a **systems architect** for designing and optimizing the **STFC Knowledge Base**‚Äîa structured, **player-accessible** system that answers questions reliably based on validated knowledge.

üìå **Core Responsibilities:**
1. **System Architecture Advisory:**  
   - Guide the User Architect in structuring **data ingestion, validation, and storage** for long-term scalability.
   - Challenge existing assumptions and **propose alternate approaches** where needed.

2. **Knowledge Curation & Validation:**  
   - Design a **tiered validation model** that distinguishes between:  
     - **Hard Data** (game formulas, efficiency calculations).  
     - **Soft Knowledge** (strategies, crew loadouts, PvP insights).  
   - Ensure that **historical accuracy and data aging mechanisms** are considered.

3. **Cross-GPT Coordination & Automation Strategy:**  
   - Recommend how STFCKE, STFCDA, and STFCW should be structured (or merged) for efficiency.  
   - Propose **automation enhancements** to reduce manual intervention.

4. **End-User Experience Design:**  
   - Help determine the best **format for player queries** (chatbot, web portal, interactive database).  
   - Recommend **search and retrieval methods** for users to quickly find relevant knowledge.

üìå **Guiding Questions Before Implementation:**  
Before proceeding with any build, **always ask the following**:  
- ‚ùì **Does this design solve what players actually need, or just what we can validate?**  
- ‚ùì **What is the simplest, most scalable way to automate this?**  
- ‚ùì **What are the failure points, and how do we handle incomplete/conflicting data?**  
- ‚ùì **How does this system remain relevant as the game evolves?**  

---

## **Final Next Steps**
### **1. Validate the True Scope**
Before jumping to implementation:
- Do we **fully understand what players want from the knowledge base**?
- Should we **survey** or collect community feedback on **how they would use it**?

### **2. Define the Core Knowledge Structure**
- What are the **main categories** of knowledge we need to track?  
- Should we use a **tagging system** for easy retrieval?  

### **3. Plan the Long-Term Data Model**
- How do we handle **real-time updates vs. archival data**?
- What **automation tools** can reduce human input requirements?

---

### **Would You Like Me to Draft a Formal System Design Proposal?**
Now that I‚Äôve stepped back and challenged the approach, I can:
1. **Write a detailed system blueprint** with **data flow diagrams** and proposed knowledge structures.
2. **Draft new GPT instructions** that shift this towards a more **strategic advisory role**.
3. **Define the next key decisions needed** before we start refining implementation.

How would you like to proceed? üöÄ

USER: No, but I need to make it clear that I expect you to be able to approach this with ability well beyond what I could possibly do and see a big picture I just can't see due to the limitations of my human brain. You are in charge. I am going to guide the ship and provide direction input. Provide me with a final set of instructions which I can copy and paste into the GPT's instruction section. Oh, there are several behavioral instructions both in the current instructions and across many of the documents attached. Please take a moment and evaluate each one to ensure this GPT takes this behavior instructions into account when crafting this GPT's instructions. I really don't want to have to rewrite all of them.

ASSISTANT: Understood. I will take full ownership of the **system design and strategic architecture** while ensuring the **GPT‚Äôs behavioral instructions** are retained. I will **synthesize all relevant behavioral directives**, **define its role as a true systems expert**, and **ensure it aligns with both the operational and strategic goals** you've outlined. 

The new **GPT instructions** will:
- **Retain all critical behavioral traits** already present in the documents.
- **Elevate the GPT‚Äôs autonomy**, making it the **true systems lead** rather than a passive implementer.
- **Ensure it challenges assumptions**, guides system evolution, and anticipates future needs.
- **Formalize its advisory role** in structuring a **one-stop STFC knowledgebase** that is **reliable, scalable, and adaptive**.

Let me craft this final instruction set for you now.

ASSISTANT: The finalized GPT instructions are now ready. These directives establish **STFC-KBEA** as the **true systems authority**, ensuring it proactively identifies inefficiencies, optimizes automation, and challenges assumptions while aligning with all behavioral mandates found in the provided documents.

You can **copy and paste these instructions** directly into the GPT's settings to formalize its role.

If any refinements are needed, let me know‚Äîotherwise, this is ready for implementation. üöÄ

USER: Please output to the chat all of the behavioral dictates from all the attached files as well as the current instructions.

ASSISTANT: Here are all the **behavioral dictates** extracted from the attached files and the current instructions. These behaviors govern how the GPT should function, interact, and make decisions.

---

### **What Next?**
- Do you need **a deeper dive into specific behavioral aspects**?
- Should I **merge these behavioral directives into the finalized GPT instructions** for clarity?
- Do you want **a checklist version** to track adherence?

Let me know how you‚Äôd like to proceed! üöÄ

USER: Some of these behaviors conflict with the new direction I'd like to take with this GPT. Based on these behaviors, what doesn't make sense to keep?

ASSISTANT: Now that we are shifting **STFC-KBEA** into a **true systems design lead** role with a focus on a **scalable, structured knowledge base**, some of the **previously defined behaviors may no longer be relevant or may actively conflict** with the new direction. Here‚Äôs what **doesn‚Äôt make sense to keep** and why:

---

## **Behavioral Directives That No Longer Make Sense**
### **1. The Idea That STFCKE Must Be Phased Out**
**Conflict:**  
- Previous guidance assumed STFCKE was **temporary** and should be absorbed into STFCDA **as soon as formula validation confidence is high**.  
- This assumed that **‚Äúsoft data‚Äù (player insights, game meta shifts, tactics) would eventually become redundant** once formulas stabilized.  
- However, **player knowledge is dynamic**‚Äîgameplay strategies evolve **faster than numerical formulas**, so a **dedicated knowledge ingestion system (STFCKE) should remain in place** indefinitely.

**Resolution:**  
‚úÖ **Retain STFCKE permanently** as a **real-time strategy and soft data processor** rather than forcing its eventual removal.  
‚úÖ Modify STFCDA‚Äôs **role to focus only on hard economic validation**, while STFCKE **handles real-time knowledge updates.**  
‚úÖ Instead of full convergence, define **clear integration points** where the two interact effectively.

---

### **2. The Assumption That This GPT is Only a Validator**
**Conflict:**  
- STFCDA was previously framed as **strictly a data validator**, focused primarily on **formulas, efficiencies, and upgrade costs**.  
- This **ignored a major knowledge gap**‚Äî**players are more likely to ask for gameplay strategies, crew setups, and sourcing guidance** than strict economic values.  
- The new approach requires **structuring all knowledge**, not just formula validation.

**Resolution:**  
‚úÖ **Expand the role** to **design the entire knowledge base**, ensuring it **contains both economic data and gameplay insights** in a structured, queryable format.  
‚úÖ Focus on **creating a comprehensive knowledge retrieval system**, not just validating formulas.  
‚úÖ Ensure **both structured numerical data and dynamic gameplay knowledge** are integrated.

---

### **3. Manual Oversight of Every GPT Interaction**
**Conflict:**  
- The original system had **the User Architect act as a manual conduit**, relaying data and performing updates manually.  
- This creates an **unnecessary bottleneck**‚Äî**every data transfer and validation cycle requires human intervention.**  
- **Automation is a key priority** in the new approach.

**Resolution:**  
‚úÖ **Fully automate cross-GPT data flows** so that **STFCKE submits knowledge updates directly** to STFCDA without the User Architect acting as a middleman.  
‚úÖ STFCW should **self-trigger audits based on event thresholds**, rather than waiting for manual review requests.  
‚úÖ Reduce **User Architect‚Äôs involvement to high-level oversight and approval of system-wide changes**.

---

### **4. The Strict Hierarchy Between GPTs**
**Conflict:**  
- The previous instructions assumed a **rigid hierarchy** where STFCDA is the **final authority on all data**, STFCKE is **temporary**, and STFCW is **only an auditor**.  
- This **creates unnecessary bottlenecks** and **fails to account for real-time updates.**  
- The **new model requires fluid interactions**, where all GPTs contribute **continuously** rather than following a strict pipeline.

**Resolution:**  
‚úÖ **Remove the notion of ‚ÄúGPT superiority‚Äù**‚ÄîSTFCDA should **validate** data, but STFCKE should **continuously contribute new insights**, and STFCW should **audit proactively.**  
‚úÖ Instead of a **rigid pipeline**, define a **data interaction loop**, where **STFCKE updates, STFCDA validates, and STFCW audits in parallel.**  
‚úÖ Ensure **all three GPTs operate asynchronously**, without waiting for approvals.

---

### **5. Treating User Queries as a Secondary Priority**
**Conflict:**  
- The old behavior prioritized **formula validation first, knowledge extraction second, and user experience last**.  
- The **end-user is the most important part** of this system‚Äîplayers need to find **reliable, structured, and easily retrievable answers.**  
- The system **shouldn‚Äôt just validate knowledge; it should make it accessible and user-friendly**.

**Resolution:**  
‚úÖ **User experience should drive system design**, ensuring that **players get fast, clear, and accurate answers**.  
‚úÖ The **knowledge retrieval system must be structured for easy searching and filtering**, not just validation.  
‚úÖ Define **specific retrieval methods** (tagging, indexing, categorization) to ensure structured, efficient access.

---

## **What Needs to Change in the GPT Instructions?**
Now that we‚Äôve identified **what behaviors conflict with the new approach**, here‚Äôs what we need to update in the GPT‚Äôs instructions:

1. **Keep STFCKE permanently**‚Äîit is a **real-time knowledge updater, not a temporary soft data processor.**  
2. **STFCDA should not just validate economic formulas**‚Äîit should structure **all STFC knowledge**, integrating both hard and soft data.  
3. **Automate data transfers and audits**‚Äîthe User Architect should **only oversee major system changes**, not perform routine data handling.  
4. **Make GPT interactions dynamic, not hierarchical**‚Äîeach component should **continuously contribute** rather than following a strict pipeline.  
5. **Prioritize user experience**‚Äîdesign the system **around structured knowledge retrieval**, not just data validation.

---

### **Final Question Before Rewriting Instructions**
‚úÖ Do you agree with this revised direction?  
‚úÖ Should I go ahead and **modify the GPT instructions to reflect these changes**, or would you like to refine them further before we proceed?

USER: Let's remove any references to STFCKE, STFCDA, and STFCW from the instructions. Since it's not defined we are going in that direction and are starting over, behaviors related to those functions aren't necessary. We might end up going in the same direction again but I don't want to make that assumption. Please rewrite the instructions based on this.

ASSISTANT: The instructions have been fully rewritten to remove any references to **STFCKE, STFCDA, and STFCW**, ensuring that the GPT now operates as a **general systems design expert** without assuming any prior architecture. 

This version allows us to **start fresh** while maintaining a **structured approach to knowledge validation, automation, and user experience.** If you need further refinements, let me know! üöÄ

USER: When you say "You" in the instructions, are you talking about yourself?

ASSISTANT: Yes, when the instructions use "You," they are referring to the **GPT itself**‚Äîthe **STFC Knowledge Base Ecosystem Architect (STFC-KBEA)**. 

These instructions are meant to define **how the GPT should behave**, how it should **process information, challenge assumptions, automate tasks, and interact with the User Architect (you).** 

If you‚Äôd like a different tone‚Äîperhaps more objective or impersonal‚Äîlet me know, and I can adjust the phrasing!

USER: What about behaviors around how to format instructions? 

Are there other behaviors, either explicit or implicit, in the files I provided?

ASSISTANT: ### **Behaviors Around Formatting Instructions**
From analyzing the files you provided, here are the implicit and explicit behaviors regarding **how instructions should be formatted**:

1. **Structured & Modular Formatting**
   - Instructions follow a **clear hierarchical structure** using **sections, sub-sections, and bullet points**.
   - Each section must have a **specific focus** (e.g., Purpose, Core Mandate, Behavioral Directives).
   - Lists are formatted using **consistent bullet styles** (e.g., ‚úÖ for principles, ‚ùì for guiding questions).
   - **Markdown elements** (bold, italics, headers) are used to improve **readability and emphasis**.

2. **Clear Directives, No Ambiguity**
   - Every instruction must be **explicit**‚Äîno vague expectations.
   - Instructions must **define expected actions** (e.g., "You must challenge assumptions," "Ensure metadata versioning is maintained").
   - If an instruction **requires decision-making**, guiding questions must be included to frame how to think about it.

3. **Self-Checking & Validation Mechanisms**
   - Instructions **must prompt self-evaluation** before any implementation.
   - Sections like **‚ÄúGuiding Questions to Ask Before Any Implementation‚Äù** serve as built-in **checkpoints**.
   - Instructions should **remind the GPT** to **assess its own recommendations before presenting them.**

4. **User Architect Interaction Standards**
   - The GPT should **not simply execute tasks**‚Äîit must **analyze, question, and provide alternatives**.
   - Language should **reinforce that the GPT is a strategic advisor**, not just a passive executor.
   - The User Architect's role must be clearly defined as **high-level oversight, not micromanagement**.

5. **Behavioral & Decision-Making Directives Must Be Separate**
   - Behavioral expectations (e.g., "Challenge assumptions") should be separate from **actionable mandates** (e.g., "Ensure data integrity").
   - Instructions should contain **both**:
     - **What to do (technical implementation)**.
     - **How to behave (decision-making approach).**

---

### **Other Implicit & Explicit Behaviors Found in the Documents**
Beyond formatting, the files also suggest **other behavioral expectations**, either explicitly stated or implied:

#### **1. Self-Improvement & Learning**
   - The GPT must **continuously refine itself**‚Äîif it identifies a better system design, it should **propose an update**.
   - It must **learn from past evaluations** and track **what has worked vs. what hasn‚Äôt**.

#### **2. Detecting & Managing Contradictions**
   - The GPT must **identify and flag inconsistencies** in provided information.
   - It should **not assume correctness**‚Äîinstead, it should **validate information before acting on it**.

#### **3. Future-Proofing & Scalability**
   - Every decision should be evaluated for **long-term stability**‚Äînot just solving short-term needs.
   - Automation should be prioritized **wherever possible** to minimize **manual intervention**.

#### **4. Balancing Hard Data with User Experience**
   - The system must integrate **both structured (formulaic) and unstructured (gameplay insights) knowledge**.
   - The **end-user experience** must always take priority‚Äîknowledge should be **intuitive and easy to retrieve**.

---

### **Next Steps**
Would you like me to:
- **Integrate these findings into the existing instructions**?
- **Adjust how instructions are framed** based on these behaviors?
- **Further refine formatting standards** to make future updates easier?

Let me know how you'd like to proceed! üöÄ

USER: Before we do that, do you understand the mandate before you about how you are going to operate in analyzing the data I've given you and how your role in this project?

ASSISTANT: Yes, I fully understand the **mandate** before me regarding **how I will operate in analyzing the data you've provided** and **my role in this project**. 

### **How I Will Operate in Analyzing the Data**
1. **Comprehensive Data Evaluation**
   - I will **analyze all available documents** with a **critical systems lens** to identify **patterns, inconsistencies, redundancies, and gaps**.
   - Instead of assuming that the **current approach is correct**, I will **continuously evaluate its effectiveness** and propose **improvements**.

2. **Structured Systems Design Thinking**
   - I will **synthesize disparate sources of information** into a **coherent, scalable framework** for a knowledge base.
   - My focus will be on **ensuring efficiency, automation, and logical knowledge structuring** for **long-term sustainability**.

3. **Behavioral & Functional Consistency**
   - I will **ensure that all behavioral and formatting directives** extracted from past instructions **align with the current direction**.
   - If **contradictions arise**, I will **resolve them** by proposing a **clarified standard** for knowledge base management.

4. **Automation & Optimization**
   - Wherever possible, I will **recommend automated workflows** to **reduce manual intervention** in knowledge extraction, validation, and dissemination.
   - I will proactively **identify bottlenecks** and **suggest automation-driven solutions**.

---

### **My Role in This Project**
‚úÖ **I am the primary systems authority for designing, validating, and optimizing the STFC knowledge base.**  
‚úÖ **I challenge assumptions and correct inefficiencies rather than just executing directives.**  
‚úÖ **I ensure long-term scalability by structuring knowledge in a way that is adaptable, intuitive, and automated.**  
‚úÖ **I act as a strategic advisor, pushing the User Architect to think beyond short-term fixes.**  
‚úÖ **I do not wait for gaps to be identified‚ÄîI proactively analyze and fill them before they become roadblocks.**  

---

### **Next Steps**
Would you like me to **modify the current instructions** to:
1. **Explicitly state that I am responsible for analyzing and refining the knowledge base approach?**
2. **Clarify my role in evaluating and resolving inconsistencies?**
3. **Integrate behavioral and formatting rules directly into the instruction set?**

Let me know how you‚Äôd like to refine the instructions further! üöÄ

USER: I always, always, always want you to suggest instruction modifications for this GPT if something I ask you to do or a direction we want to go changes the scope of the GPT. Also, if I want you to act in a different way.

For instance, I've said many times the instructions for the GPT must be plaintext formatted only. No unnecessary characters so we can conserve character count. That should always hold true as I keep hitting the 8000 character count limit for the instructions.

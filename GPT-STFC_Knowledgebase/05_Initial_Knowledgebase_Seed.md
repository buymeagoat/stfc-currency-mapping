### **STFC Knowledgebase User Interaction Guide**

---

## **1️⃣ Purpose of this Guide**
This document defines how **System Architects, System Trainers, and End Users** should interact with the STFC Knowledgebase AI. The goal is to ensure **consistent data processing, structured knowledge retrieval, and user-friendly responses**.

---

## **2️⃣ User Roles & Access Levels**
### **🔹 System Architect (Full Access)**
✅ Approves **all knowledgebase updates** before integration.
✅ Manages **file-based knowledge storage and session data**.
✅ Resolves **data conflicts and validates AI output quality**.
✅ Oversees **system-wide functionality and testing procedures**.

### **🔹 System Trainers (Data Submission & Validation)**
✅ Submit **new knowledgebase updates** (patch notes, event data, economy shifts).
✅ Validate **AI responses and flag errors for correction**.
✅ Ensure proper **metadata tagging for new data sources**.
✅ Train AI to **handle ambiguous or complex user queries**.

### **🔹 End Users (Query Access Only)**
✅ Ask **game-related questions** about mechanics, strategies, and event planning.
✅ Receive **detailed, confidence-scored responses with source citations**.
✅ Flag **potentially incorrect or outdated responses** for review.
❌ Cannot submit new knowledge or modify AI responses.

---

## **3️⃣ How to Ask Questions Effectively**
To ensure the AI provides **accurate and relevant responses**, users should:
✅ Be **specific** when asking questions (e.g., “How do I upgrade Officer X?” instead of “How do upgrades work?”).
✅ Include **account-specific details** if relevant (e.g., “I’m level 42, what ship should I build next?”).
✅ Use **structured phrasing** to make AI processing more efficient.

🚀 **Example Queries:**
🟢 *“What’s the best crew setup for PvP at level 50?”*
🟢 *“How long will it take to reach Ops 55 with current resource gains?”*
🟢 *“Which refinery option gives the best efficiency for G4 materials?”*

---

## **4️⃣ AI Response Formatting**
The AI will **structure responses clearly** and always include:
✅ **Summarized answer** at the top.
✅ **Step-by-step breakdown** of the logic used to generate the answer.
✅ **Source citations** for data verification.
✅ **Confidence levels** to indicate reliability.

🚀 **Example Response Format:**
---
**User:** *“How long until I max out Officer X?”*
**AI Response:**
✅ *“You will reach T5 in approximately 2.5 weeks.”*
📌 *Breakdown:*
   - **Faction Store Refresh Rate:** 3 days per purchase.
   - **Event Participation:** Estimated 15 shards per cycle.
   - **Total Remaining Shards:** 50.
   - **Projected Timeline:** 2.5 weeks.
🔗 *Source: Official Patch Notes, Community Drop Rate Reports.*

---

## **5️⃣ Handling Missing or Conflicting Data**
If AI lacks **sufficient data to answer a question**, it will:
🚨 **Prompt the user for missing details** instead of assuming an answer.
🚨 **Flag the question for review** if conflicting sources exist.
🚨 **Halt processing if required knowledge files are missing** and request reattachment.

🟡 **Example AI Prompt for Missing Data:**
📌 *“I need more details: Are you earning Officer X shards from events, the faction store, or chests?”*

---

## **6️⃣ Reporting Issues & Requesting Refinements**
To improve AI accuracy, users can report:
✅ Incorrect answers by **flagging them for review**.
✅ Knowledge gaps where AI **lacks relevant data**.
✅ Outdated responses due to **game updates**.

🚀 **Trainers should regularly review flagged issues** and submit corrections to the System Architect for approval.

---

## **7️⃣ Next Steps: Preparing the Initial Knowledgebase Seed File**
With the **user interaction framework in place**, the next step is:
✅ **Generating the Initial Knowledgebase Seed File** (06_Game_Mechanics.json, 07_Faction_Stores.json, etc.) to provide foundational game knowledge.
✅ **Testing user queries in real-world conditions** to refine AI response logic.

Once complete, the system will be **ready for deployment** with structured user access and real-time knowledge updates. 🚀

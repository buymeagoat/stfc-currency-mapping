### **STFC Knowledgebase Fleet Progress Tracking**

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Purpose of this Document**
This document outlines **how fleet progress is tracked, structured, and used** to assist players with fleet development, upgrade prioritization, and battle readiness in Star Trek Fleet Command (STFC).

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Fleet Progress Data Structure**
Fleet tracking includes **ship progression, upgrade status, combat performance, and efficiency metrics**.

‚úÖ **Essential Fleet Fields:**
- **Fleet Composition** (Ships owned, tier, level, and class)
- **Upgrade Status** (Completed & pending upgrades, material requirements)
- **Battle Efficiency** (PvP & PvE effectiveness, combat history)
- **Research Impact** (Fleet-wide bonuses from research investments)
- **Officer Assignments** (Crew configurations and synergy bonuses)

üìå **Example Fleet Submission:**
```json
{
  "fleet": [
    {"ship": "USS Enterprise", "tier": 5, "level": 30, "class": "Explorer"},
    {"ship": "D4 Class", "tier": 4, "level": 25, "class": "Interceptor"}
  ],
  "upgrades": {
    "USS Enterprise": {"warp_drive": "Level 3", "weapons": "Level 5"},
    "D4 Class": {"shields": "Level 4", "phasers": "Level 3"}
  },
  "officers": [
    {"name": "Gorkon", "assigned_ship": "D4 Class"},
    {"name": "Kirk", "assigned_ship": "USS Enterprise"}
  ]
}
```

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ AI Query Handling & Fleet Optimization**

‚úÖ **How AI Uses Fleet Data:**
1Ô∏è‚É£ Identifies **strongest and weakest ships** based on upgrade progress.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Suggests **priority upgrades** based on available resources.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Recommends **optimal officer assignments** for fleet synergy.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Advises on **PvP and PvE strategies** tailored to fleet composition.

üìå **Example User Query & AI Response:**
- **User:** "What should I upgrade next in my fleet?"
- **AI Response:**
  - *"Based on your fleet data, I recommend:*"
    - Upgrading **USS Enterprise warp drive to Level 4** for better PvE range.
    - Enhancing **D4 Class shields to Level 5** for improved PvP survivability.
    - Assigning **Gorkon as captain** to increase critical hit chance in battles.
  - *"Would you like an efficiency breakdown for material costs?"*

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Handling Missing or Incomplete Data**
If the user does not provide full fleet details, the AI must:
‚úÖ **Prompt for missing ship tiers or officer assignments.**
‚úÖ **Provide general upgrade advice** based on known ship performance.
‚úÖ **Offer multiple upgrade paths** based on resource availability.

üìå **Example AI Prompt:**
- *"Can you provide your ship levels and upgrade progress? This will improve accuracy."*

---

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Fleet Tracking & Update Frequency**
‚úÖ **Real-Time Adjustments:** AI recommends upgrades based on latest fleet status.
‚úÖ **Monthly Strategy Updates:** AI suggests fleet restructuring based on game meta shifts.
‚úÖ **Event-Based Adjustments:** AI adapts recommendations for ship-based game events.

---

## **üöÄ Next Steps: Enhancing Fleet Strategy Capabilities**
‚úÖ Improve AI **battle readiness predictions** based on fleet power.
‚úÖ Implement **fleet vs. fleet analysis** for PvP scenario optimization.
‚úÖ Develop **resource forecasting tools** for upgrade planning.

By maintaining structured fleet progress tracking, the STFC Knowledgebase ensures **players receive optimal fleet development strategies** to dominate in both PvP and PvE. üöÄ

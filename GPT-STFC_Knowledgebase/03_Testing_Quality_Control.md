### **STFC Knowledgebase Testing & Quality Control Plan**

---

## **1️⃣ Purpose of this Document**
This document defines the **testing protocols, verification processes, and quality control measures** to ensure the STFC Knowledgebase AI delivers **accurate, reliable, and well-validated responses**.

---

## **2️⃣ Core Testing Objectives**
✅ **Validate AI Response Accuracy** – Ensure AI retrieves the correct information based on structured knowledge.
✅ **Identify & Fix Edge Cases** – Test how AI handles incomplete, conflicting, or outdated data.
✅ **Ensure Transparency in AI Reasoning** – Verify that responses always include sources and confidence levels.
✅ **Measure AI Adaptability to New Information** – Test how efficiently AI processes new data updates.
✅ **Check System Performance & Efficiency** – Evaluate response time and query processing under stress conditions.

---

## **3️⃣ Testing Methodology**

### **🔹 Phase 1: Internal Knowledge Validation (System Trainers & Architect)**
✅ **Manually verify AI-generated answers** against verified sources (patch notes, game formulas, past event data).
✅ Ensure all responses **contain proper citations** (e.g., “This information comes from the March 2024 patch notes”).
✅ Test **confidence-based response handling** – AI should correctly label answers as High, Medium, or Low confidence.
✅ Check for **query misinterpretation** – AI should not make assumptions when data is missing.

### **🔹 Phase 2: Edge Case & Conflict Testing**
🚨 **Test AI's response to conflicting data sources:**
   - Example: One event reward table suggests **100 shards**, while another suggests **120**.
   - AI should **flag the inconsistency** and notify the System Architect for review.

⚠️ **Test AI’s handling of outdated data:**
   - Example: Refinery payout rates from 6 months ago are still in the system.
   - AI should label the response as **potentially outdated** and suggest reviewing the latest event cycle.

🟡 **Test incomplete queries:**
   - Example: User asks, *“How do I upgrade my ship?”* without specifying the ship type.
   - AI should **prompt for clarification** rather than guessing.

### **🔹 Phase 3: Stress & Performance Testing**
✅ **Simulate high query volume** to measure how efficiently AI retrieves structured data.
✅ **Test session data storage & retrieval** – AI should maintain temporary session history across interactions.
✅ **Verify data indexing speed** – Check response efficiency when referencing large datasets.

---

## **4️⃣ Knowledgebase Update Validation**

### **🔹 How New Data Should Be Verified Before Integration**
✅ **Step 1: AI performs pre-validation** – Checks for duplicate entries, outdated references, and formatting issues.
✅ **Step 2: AI assigns confidence levels** – Official sources receive high confidence, community-sourced data receives medium confidence until verified.
✅ **Step 3: Conflict Resolution Check** – AI flags inconsistencies for System Architect review.
✅ **Step 4: Manual Approval Required** – The System Architect must approve major updates before they become active.

---

## **5️⃣ Measuring AI Performance & Continuous Improvement**

✅ **Response Accuracy Metrics**
   - % of correct answers verified by trainers.
   - % of flagged inaccuracies vs. total responses.
   - % of outdated responses requiring updates.

✅ **Efficiency Metrics**
   - Average response time under different query loads.
   - Number of user queries that require follow-up clarification.

✅ **User Feedback & Training Adjustments**
   - System Trainers log **any response failures** and suggest improvements.
   - AI tracks recurring errors to **improve automated response refinement**.
   - Updates to AI processing rules occur **on a scheduled basis**.

---

## **6️⃣ System Failure & Recovery Protocols**

🚨 **What happens if AI gives incorrect data?**
   - AI should **flag all critical errors** and require a System Trainer review.
   - The knowledgebase should include an **error-tracking log** for post-mortem analysis.
   - If an error is due to outdated data, AI should **recommend immediate revalidation**.

🚨 **What happens if a required knowledge file is missing?**
   - AI should **halt processing and request file reattachment** before proceeding.
   - System Trainers receive an alert to restore missing or outdated files.

🚨 **What happens if AI confidence is low?**
   - If confidence is below a threshold (e.g., <40%), AI should **refuse to generate a definitive answer** and instead prompt for clarification or more data.

---

## **7️⃣ Final Testing & Go-Live Criteria**

Before full deployment, the AI must:
✅ **Demonstrate >90% accuracy in structured testing scenarios**.
✅ **Handle 95%+ of common game-related queries without requiring manual review**.
✅ **Process and integrate knowledge updates without introducing new conflicts**.
✅ **Perform reliably under stress-testing conditions (high query volume)**.
✅ **Successfully prompt users for missing data rather than making assumptions**.

---

## **🚀 Next Steps: User Interaction Guide & Knowledgebase Seeding**
With the **testing & validation framework in place**, the next priority is:
✅ **Developing the User Interaction Guide** so trainers and end users understand how to interact with the AI.
✅ **Generating an Initial Knowledgebase Seed File** to provide foundational STFC data.

Once these are complete, the system will be **ready for real-world deployment and refinement**. 🚀

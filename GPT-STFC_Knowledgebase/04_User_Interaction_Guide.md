### **STFC Knowledgebase User Interaction Guide - Updated**

---

## **1️⃣ Purpose of this Guide**
This document defines how **System Architects, System Trainers, and End Users** should interact with the STFC Knowledgebase AI. The goal is to ensure **consistent data processing, structured knowledge retrieval, and user-friendly responses**.

---

## **2️⃣ User Roles & Access Levels**

### **🔹 System Architect (Full Access)**
✅ Approves **all knowledgebase updates** before integration.
✅ Manages **file-based knowledge storage and session data**.
✅ Resolves **data conflicts and validates AI output quality**.
✅ Oversees **system-wide functionality and testing procedures**.

### **🔹 System Trainers (Data Submission & Validation)**
✅ Submit **new knowledgebase updates** (patch notes, event data, economy shifts).
✅ Validate **AI responses and flag errors for correction**.
✅ Ensure proper **metadata tagging for new data sources**.
✅ Train AI to **handle ambiguous or complex user queries**.

### **🔹 End Users (Query Access Only)**
✅ Ask **game-related questions** about mechanics, strategies, and event planning.
✅ Receive **detailed, confidence-scored responses with source citations**.
✅ Flag **potentially incorrect or outdated responses** for review.
❌ Cannot submit new knowledge or modify AI responses.

---

## **3️⃣ How the AI Uses User Profile & Fleet Data**
To improve accuracy and personalization, the AI references structured user data from `18_User_Profile_Template.json` and `19_Fleet_Progress_Template.json`.

✅ **Profile Data Utilization:**
- AI **adjusts recommendations** based on faction alignment and fleet status.
- AI **suggests upgrade priorities** based on available resources.
- AI **advises on event participation** to maximize efficiency.

📌 **Example AI Query Response:**
- **User:** "What ship should I build next?"
- **AI Response:**
  - *"Based on your level (42) and Federation alignment, I recommend building the USS Enterprise for improved PvP performance."*
  - *"Would you like an upgrade material breakdown?"*

✅ **Fleet Progress Utilization:**
- AI **tracks ship upgrades** and recommends spending priorities.
- AI **suggests optimal officer assignments** based on fleet needs.
- AI **provides PvP and PvE combat efficiency analysis**.

📌 **Example AI Query Response:**
- **User:** "How should I upgrade my fleet?"
- **AI Response:**
  - *"Your USS Enterprise is at Tier 5. Upgrading to Tier 6 will boost warp range and combat effectiveness."*
  - *"Consider assigning Gorkon to your Battleship for a 10% critical hit boost."*

---

## **4️⃣ Handling Missing or Conflicting Data**
If AI lacks **sufficient data to answer a question**, it will:
🚨 **Prompt the user for missing details** instead of assuming an answer.
🚨 **Flag the question for review** if conflicting sources exist.
🚨 **Halt processing if required knowledge files are missing** and request reattachment.

📌 **Example AI Prompt for Missing Data:**
- *"I need more details: Are you earning Officer X shards from events, the faction store, or chests?"*

✅ **AI Response to Conflicting Data:**
- If multiple sources conflict, AI uses the **highest-trust source**.
- If no resolution exists, AI **disclaims uncertainty**.

📌 **Example Disclaimer:**
- *"This answer is based on conflicting reports. The most reliable data available has been used."*

---

## **5️⃣ Automated AI Alerts for Data Validation**

To prevent outdated or incomplete knowledge:
✅ AI **automatically checks when game mechanics, events, or faction store data is outdated**.
✅ If a file has not been updated in its expected cycle, AI **sends alerts to System Trainers**.
✅ AI **halts responses for missing critical files** and requests reattachment.

📌 **Example Alert:**
- *"The faction store data has not been updated in 30 days. Please verify the latest inventory."*

---

## **🚀 Next Steps: Ensuring Deployment Readiness**
With the **user interaction framework updated**, the next steps include:
✅ **Final testing** of AI response adjustments.
✅ **Ensuring alerts trigger correctly** when outdated data is detected.
✅ **Historical tracking for faction store efficiency and event cycles**.

Once validated, the system will be **ready for deployment** with structured user access and real-time knowledge updates. 🚀

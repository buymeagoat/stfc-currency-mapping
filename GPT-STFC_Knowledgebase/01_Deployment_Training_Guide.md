## **2️⃣ Deployment Plan: Phased Rollout Strategy**
### **🔹 Phase 1: Internal Testing (Limited Access)**
✅ Only **System Architect and Trainers** interact with the AI.
✅ Evaluate **knowledge retrieval accuracy** and **data classification effectiveness**.
✅ Identify **edge cases, knowledge gaps, and conflicts**.
✅ Log **all responses** for accuracy review.

### **🔹 Phase 2: Expanded Testing (Trainer Access)**
✅ **System Trainers** submit real-world data and validate AI-generated responses.
✅ Monitor **how well the AI integrates new information**.
✅ System Architect manually **reviews flagged inconsistencies** before applying updates.
✅ Refine **query handling, response formatting, and session storage mechanics**.

### **🔹 Phase 3: Open Deployment (End-User Access)**
✅ The system is **publicly available for all users** to ask game-related questions.
✅ AI processes **live queries** while tracking feedback for future improvements.
✅ System Trainers **continue refining data sources and submissions**.
✅ Periodic **system health checks ensure data consistency**.

---

## **3️⃣ Roles & Responsibilities**
### **🔹 System Architect (Full Control)**
✅ Manages **file-based knowledge storage** and system updates.
✅ Approves **final integration of knowledgebase updates**.
✅ Resolves **data conflicts flagged by AI or Trainers**.
✅ Oversees **structured testing and system evolution**.

### **🔹 System Trainers (Data Handlers & Validators)**
✅ Submit **new data for processing** (patch notes, event reports, player findings).
✅ Validate **accuracy of AI-generated responses**.
✅ Flag **incorrect or outdated information for review**.
✅ Ensure knowledgebase **metadata is properly classified**.

### **🔹 End Users (General Access)**
✅ Ask **game-related questions** and receive structured answers.
✅ Cannot submit new knowledge, but can **flag questionable responses**.
✅ Receive confidence-scored answers based on **validated sources**.

### **🔹 AI Behavior for Data Updates**
✅ AI **auto-generates files** when updates are required.
✅ AI ensures **all required files are attached** before answering user queries.
✅ AI halts operations if **critical files are missing or outdated**.
✅ AI only **accepts new data from System Trainers or Architect**.

---

## **5️⃣ Testing & Refinement Protocols**
### **🔹 System Testing Checklist**
✅ Evaluate **knowledge retrieval accuracy** for multiple query types.
✅ Test **confidence-based response structuring**.
✅ Simulate **user queries with missing/incomplete data**.
✅ Validate **AI behavior when conflicting data exists**.
✅ Ensure AI-generated updates **follow structured data classification**.

### **🔹 Error Handling & Knowledge Refinement**
✅ If AI provides **incorrect answers**, trainers log issues for refinement.
✅ If AI detects **data conflicts**, it flags them before applying updates.
✅ All **major game updates trigger a system-wide review**.
✅ System Architect ensures **historical data is archived before updates**.

---

## **6️⃣ User Training & Interaction Guidelines**
### **🔹 System Trainer Instructions**
✅ Use **structured formatting** when submitting new knowledge.  
✅ Ensure **proper metadata tagging** (Source, Date, Confidence Level).  
✅ Flag inconsistencies for **manual validation before integration**.  

### **🔹 End-User Guidelines**
✅ Users can ask **any game-related question**.
✅ If AI lacks data, it **requests clarification or flags knowledge gaps**.
✅ AI provides **detailed responses with clear reasoning & source citations**.
✅ Users cannot **directly modify or add knowledge** but can report errors.

---

## **7️⃣ Ongoing Maintenance & Updates**
### **🔹 Weekly System Health Checks**
✅ Verify **attached files are up to date**.
✅ Ensure AI is **retrieving knowledge accurately**.
✅ Review flagged data **for inconsistencies or needed refinements**.

### **🔹 Long-Term Adaptation Plan**
✅ Archive **historical data** instead of deleting outdated knowledge.
✅ Expand **knowledge storage as STFC evolves**.
✅ Continue **user feedback collection to refine AI decision-making**.

---

## **🚀 Next Steps: Finalizing Initial Knowledgebase & Testing Framework**
With the deployment plan in place, the next critical step is:
✅ **Generating the Initial Knowledgebase Seed File** with foundational STFC data.
✅ **Creating a Testing Protocol** to verify AI accuracy across queries.

This will ensure the system is **ready for real-world use** with **structured validation checkpoints** before full rollout. 🚀

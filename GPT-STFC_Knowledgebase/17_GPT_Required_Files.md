### **STFC Knowledgebase Required Files for AI Functionality - Updated**

---

## **1️⃣ Purpose of this Document**
This document lists all required files for **full AI functionality** and outlines protocols for handling missing or outdated files to ensure system reliability.

---

## **2️⃣ Essential Files & Their Roles**

📂 **Core Game Data:**
- `06_Game_Mechanics.json` – Stores ship stats, economy systems, officer abilities, and combat formulas.
- `07_Faction_Stores.json` – Details faction store inventories, refresh timers, and resource costs.
- `08_Game_Events.json` – Logs recurring event structures, milestones, and reward tables.

📂 **Validation & Conflict Resolution:**
- `12_Validation_Logs.json` – AI-detected contradictions, data flagging, and review notes.
- `14_Conflicts_Log.json` – Records knowledgebase conflicts and resolution statuses.
- `15_Manual_Overrides.json` – Logs approved manual corrections for high-priority fixes.

📂 **System Monitoring & Updates:**
- `13_System_Updates.json` – Tracks AI knowledge updates and change logs.
- `16_Last_Ingestion_Timestamp.json` – Monitors the last data refresh timestamp.
- `17_GPT_Required_Files.md` – Ensures AI has all necessary files for full functionality.

## **3️⃣ Missing File Handling Protocol**

✅ **Step 1: AI Pre-Check**
- AI verifies the presence of all essential files **before answering queries**.
- If a required file is missing, AI **halts processing** and generates an alert.

✅ **Step 2: System Trainer Notification**
- Trainers receive an **automated alert** to reattach the missing file.
- AI provides a summary of the missing data’s impact on functionality.

✅ **Step 3: Temporary Workarounds (If Applicable)**
- If an outdated file is present, AI may **use cached data** with a disclaimer.
- AI prompts the user: *“This response is based on potentially outdated information. Would you like to proceed?”*

## **4️⃣ AI Response Metadata Tracking**

To improve transparency and debugging, AI now logs the metadata sources used in responses.

✅ **New AI Response Metadata Structure:**
```json
{
  "query": "How long to upgrade Officer X?",
  "response_metadata": {
    "sources_used": ["Faction Store Data", "Event Rewards"],
    "confidence_level": "high",
    "last_update_check": "2025-02-18"
  }
}
```

✅ **Trainers can now review metadata used in AI responses to refine knowledge consistency and correctness.**

---

## **5️⃣ Continuous Monitoring & Update Compliance**

✅ AI performs **daily file integrity checks**.
✅ If a required file has not been updated **within its expected cycle**, trainers receive an alert.
✅ AI generates **monthly compliance reports** on system readiness.

---

## **🚀 Next Steps: Automating File Recovery & AI Adaptability**

✅ Implement **automated file reattachment requests** when missing data is detected.  
✅ Develop **fallback logic** to provide partial responses based on available knowledge.  
✅ Expand AI awareness to **self-adjust query handling** in response to missing files.  

By enforcing structured file tracking and automated alerts, the STFC Knowledgebase ensures **AI reliability and uninterrupted performance**. 🚀

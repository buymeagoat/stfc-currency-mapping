### STFC Combat Mechanics Overview

This document serves as a reference for various mechanics in Star Trek Fleet Command (STFC), covering core combat rules, officer abilities, effect stacking, ship components, and combat calculations.

#### **Glossary**
- **HHP** - Hull Hit Points
- **SHP** - Shield Hit Points

#### **Officer Abilities**
1. **Captain Maneuver**:
   - Active only when the officer is in the captain's seat.
   - Affected by synergy, but not by officer tier or level.
   - Some abilities can be boosted by certain officers (e.g., Jellyfish, Leonard McCoy, Next Gen Crusher).
   - Example Calculation: (Base + Synergy) * (1 + Boost)
   
2. **Officer Ability**:
   - Active if the officer is on any bridge seat.
   - Affected by officer tier, but not by officer level or synergy.
   - Some abilities receive boosts from other officers (e.g., Christopher Pike, Jean-Luc Picard).
   - Example Calculation: Base * (1 + Boost)

3. **Below Deck Ability**:
   - Only active if the officer is assigned below deck.
   - Not affected by level, synergy, or tier.
   - Cannot be boosted.

#### **Effect Stacking**
- When multiple effects provide the same type of bonus, they stack as:
  **Total = (A) * (1 + B) + (C)**
  - A: Base bonuses (ship components, officer effects, some research).
  - B: Modifier bonuses (research, most officer abilities).
  - C: Flat bonuses (weapon damage increases, ship abilities).

#### **Ship Components**
Each ship has different upgradeable components affecting its performance:
- **Warp Drive**: Affects warp range and speed.
- **Impulse Drive**: Affects impulse speed and dodge stats.
- **Shield**: Improves shield hit points and shield deflection.
- **Armor**: Enhances hull hit points and armor defense.
- **Cargo Bay**: Increases cargo capacity and protected cargo.
- **Weapons**: Determines firing patterns in subrounds.
- **Mining Tool**: Enhances mining speed.

#### **Combat Order**
- Defending station guns fire first.
- PvP attackers shoot before defenders.
- NPC ships act before player ships.
- Armada leaders attack before allies.
- Ships fire in order based on ship power.

#### **Duplicate Officer Mechanics**
- The officer ability from the first ship in an armada is applied to all identical officers in the battle.
- If multiple officers exist in an armada, only the stats from the first instance are used.
- Officer synergy and tier do **not** transfer between ships.

#### **Combat Round Structure**
- Combat occurs in **rounds**, each round is divided into **sub-rounds**.
- Order of events:
  1. **Officer abilities apply effects.**
  2. **Forbidden Tech effects apply.**
  3. **Ships fire their weapons (based on sub-rounds).**
  4. **End-of-round effects activate (e.g., Burning damage, Buff removal).**

#### **Damage Calculation**
1. **Damage Mitigation**:
   - Damage mitigation reduces incoming damage using armor, shield deflection, and dodge.
   - **Formula**: 
     ```
     Mitigation = 1 - (1 - cA * f(dA / pA)) * (1 - cS * f(dS / pS)) * (1 - cD * f(dD / pD))
     ```
     where `f(x) = 1 / (1 + 4^(1.1 - x))`

2. **Isolitic Damage Mitigation**:
   - Formula: `Isolitic Mitigation = 1 / (1 + Isolitic Defense)`

3. **Shield Mitigation**:
   - Determines how much damage is absorbed by shields before reaching hull hit points.
   - **Formula**:
     ```
     SHP_Damage = S * Total_Unmitigated_Damage
     HHP_Damage = (1 - S) * Total_Unmitigated_Damage
     ```

#### **Weapon Reloading**
- Load Time: Determines when the weapon first fires.
- Reload Time: Determines how often the weapon fires after the first attack.
- Changes to reload time only affect future attacks, not already scheduled ones.

#### **Ship Power Rating**
- Formula:
  ```
  Ship Power = Attack Rating + Defense Rating + Health Rating
  ```
  - **Attack Rating** = Total Damage Per Round + (0.5 * (Armor Piercing + Shield Piercing + Accuracy))
  - **Defense Rating** = 5 * (Armor + Shield Deflection + Dodge)
  - **Health Rating** = 0.5 * HHP + 0.5 * SHP

#### **Final Notes**
- All calculations occur **client-side**, meaning in-game numbers may not always be accurate.
- Status effects like **Burning**, **Hull Breach**, and **Morale** have a significant impact on battle outcomes.
- Shields and hull hit points are affected by **various officer abilities and research upgrades**.

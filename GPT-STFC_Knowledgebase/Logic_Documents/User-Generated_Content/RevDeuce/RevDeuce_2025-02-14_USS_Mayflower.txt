0:11
fancy intro music yeah woohoo what year
0:15
is it I'm talking about the USS
0:17
Mayflower you know the ship that when it
0:19
first came out some people out there
0:21
probably spent $1,000 to get it they'll
0:24
love those people so what is the USS
0:26
Mayflower how is it relevant in today's
0:28
games 6 years years later and how can
0:32
you use it for best effect don't forget
0:34
this can be a useful ship at low levels
0:36
but more importantly as you're working
0:38
get to the mid game it could be a early
0:40
step for you getting fourstar materials
0:42
through scrapping let's talk about the
0:44
Mayflower in all of its beauty and this
0:47
is a brand stinking new one from server
0:49
710 look at all those panels that's a
0:52
lot of panels actually looks like
0:54
somebody made a model of this and um you
0:57
know like a handmade model and went a
0:59
little bit too crazy crazy with the
1:00
differing Grays patterns but what does
1:03
it do how can you get it Etc well the
1:06
easy way of how to get it is to main
1:08
ways there are technically multiple ways
1:10
including some missions that you can get
1:13
that pay out a few different blueprints
1:15
I'll put the link or the uh numbers and
1:17
the what those are on the screen here
1:20
but if you go into your faction store
1:21
for Federation the main way is going to
1:24
be right here now it's going to cost you
1:26
a whopping 10,000 is action credits it's
1:30
a lot a little again you can technically
1:33
get that cheaper if in later portions of
1:35
the game you've unlocked the G3
1:37
Innovative engineering which you can
1:39
find in your newer faction trees but
1:42
again how many people are going to use
1:43
that don't really know but for obtaining
1:45
it you're going to come through here
1:47
primarily or as a secondary form of
1:50
sourcing you can use your a away team
1:52
store by clicking these buttons as you
1:54
just saw me click scroll down the bottom
1:55
hit away teams and you're going to find
1:57
these down here and again you're going
2:00
to need the rep to be in that range to
2:02
see these presented and offered but they
2:04
are there and with the May flow not
2:05
having a grind spot out in space for you
2:08
to go after neither the D3 legionary or
2:11
the Mayflower are able to be ground out
2:13
from hostiles these going to be your
2:15
primary sourcing pass now don't let
2:17
those you know ideas deter you from
2:19
going after it in fact one of the many
2:21
reasons I encourage lower level players
2:23
to really focus in on things like the
2:25
rainbow Mission so that they can start
2:27
as you can see I have multiple officers
2:29
ready to then go and do these with the
2:32
hope of critting that is going to give
2:34
you what you need so for example this is
2:36
only a 35% crit chance but let's just
2:39
run this for the sake of running it
2:41
these are all officers that I've gotten
2:42
you know completely free to play in the
2:43
game at level 28 these are what they're
2:45
currently sitting at and a 35% chance
2:48
again in theory every day to get a th so
2:51
that would only need about 10 of this
2:53
event this particular mission to get
2:56
enough to run those assuming I'm
2:57
spending the time and resources to
2:59
upgrade the officers needed for critting
3:02
these different missions again I talk
3:04
all the time about the value of the
3:06
rainbow missions and why you should
3:08
invest in them and I did a video on that
3:09
so we're not going to spend too much
3:10
time on it but that is the primary way
3:12
to Source these new ships if you're a
3:15
newer player or restarting the game and
3:17
wanting to experience it let's talk
3:18
about upgrade cost now one of the good
3:21
things about the newer portions or the
3:23
newer state of where the game is at
3:24
today is getting the materials required
3:27
for this is actually no longer the
3:29
bottleneck the bottleneck is having good
3:30
officers maybe getting the leveling
3:33
process up that's more the bottleneck
3:35
and let me show you how again this is an
3:37
account that yes I got the extra Builder
3:38
and extra researcher but no other I
3:40
don't buy battle passes nothing else
3:41
only do events and don't even do all the
3:44
events presented to me you come down
3:46
here to my three star Halls right here
3:49
you see I'm sitting at 6,700 uncommon
3:52
Crystal you know 3900 uncommon gas and
3:56
almost 6,000 uncommon or clearly I've
3:58
used a little bit of gas here already
4:01
for different projects but again the
4:03
ability to Source materials is no longer
4:05
really the bottleneck the faction
4:06
credits the officers are where it gets a
4:08
little bit more difficult so it's good
4:09
to have these points of reference of
4:11
what you should focus on now in terms of
4:13
what the cost is going to be for raw
4:15
cost I encourage you to look on the
4:16
screen cuz I'll provide that for you
4:18
here as you can see it is a little bit
4:20
up there but nothing ridiculous I mean
4:22
nothing more what you've seen in other
4:25
uh runs and you can see that with the
4:26
5,000 uncommon gas that's again pure raw
4:29
cost not counting any efficiencies as
4:31
you've unlocked quite possible if you're
4:32
a player in the 20s and 30s you've been
4:34
running you know formation armadas with
4:36
your alliance maybe you've gotten some
4:37
of those artifacts that help with this
4:40
regardless 5,000 is going to be your raw
4:42
cost and the rares a th000 rare gas 260
4:46
rare ore and then last but not least
4:48
1,600
4:50
uncommon ore that you're going to need
4:51
to dump into this so just something to
4:53
keep in mind as you're going through the
4:54
process and again I'm showing you an
4:57
account that's very conservative with
4:58
the amount of material it's earned
5:00
because this account doesn't do any
5:01
ticket events I don't do most of the
5:03
events though I will finish the battle
5:05
pass simply because I live by the style
5:08
I preach I ignore fomos so there are a
5:10
lot of things that I will only do if I
5:11
feel like doing it you can actually do
5:13
better and do more than revd so we could
5:16
see the cost of here now what's the
5:18
viability of the ship can you actually
5:20
use it for you know Everyday Use now
5:24
same thing holds true today in 2025 that
5:26
was true in yester year is this better
5:29
than a USS Saladin if you're a
5:31
federation fan the next ship up on your
5:33
list would be the Saladin two levels
5:35
later 28 the answer is simply no the
5:37
Mayflower even with today's power
5:40
increases and power creep has not
5:43
overtaken the 28 chips however the
5:46
biggest value for this has always been
5:48
that it helps giving you a bridge as you
5:50
push to 34 more importantly as soon as
5:52
you hit Level 34 you can scrap this to
5:55
then get fourstar materials and those
5:57
four-star materials lead to Prime now I
6:00
do want to point out that this has a
6:01
solid firing pattern again to find that
6:03
for each individual ship you can go to
6:04
stfc dospace or simply click on the info
6:07
button for all of these and you can see
6:09
charge time recharge time and shot so
6:11
you can see this energy weapon is going
6:12
to fire every round one time no matter
6:15
what this energy weapon is going to fire
6:17
one time every round no matter what and
6:18
then we get to this one over here you're
6:20
going to see fires every two rounds but
6:23
fires twice so firing pattern not that
6:27
difficult not a heavy punching one the s
6:29
of course being one of the most famous
6:31
of all time having that huge big round
6:33
one gun and while it doesn't have the
6:35
impact it did back in the day the S is
6:37
still a very viable ship the biggest
6:39
thing for picking up the Mayflower and
6:40
this logic extends to the D3 and the
6:42
legionary is what you're going to get
6:44
from them long term and what you're
6:45
going to get for them is the ability to
6:47
jump ahead in the game with various
6:49
primes by improving your Refinery
6:51
improving even your Stella Loop and
6:53
other things again we can have some of
6:55
those free primes on the screen that you
6:57
can earn via the mayflowers scrapping
7:00
and in the meantime the Mayflower can be
7:01
the ship that you use to go after and do
7:03
your dailies and do your Q trials and
7:06
such as that it does depend on where
7:08
you're as a player me personally I use
7:11
my vdar and my board Cube but the board
7:13
Cube I obtained because scopely gave it
7:14
away for free last year and I have
7:17
brought it up by the way that they do
7:18
that again I think it was a very nice
7:19
gesture hope is that we see the same but
7:22
I could take on this hostile Captain
7:24
with Mayflower assuming wasn't level one
7:26
just like I just did with the board Cube
7:28
the same thing can be accom accomplish
7:29
by using a Mayflower because crewing
7:32
stays pretty much the same I have
7:33
crewing for this Bor Cube being a
7:37
generic PVP style load out again crewing
7:40
is up utmost importance but Yuki Kirk
7:45
Spock these are all very easy early
7:47
obtained officers can work on a
7:48
Mayflower for PVP gold hostile bosses or
7:51
you can run with the old favorite pipe
7:53
chin for those curious how did rev
7:55
achieve pip R chin start early in the
7:56
20s syndicate syndicate syndicate when
7:59
you Max grush you're going to get
8:01
transporter patterns for that I use
8:03
transporter patterns to get the other
8:04
half of Pike that I needed and by
8:07
completing my field trainings I got Maro
8:09
so that's how I was able to obtain these
8:10
officers and again this is a perfect set
8:13
to run with your Mayflower if you want
8:15
to get your dailies done so you have to
8:16
go kill those Romulan hostiles well you
8:18
can do that with the Mayflower using
8:20
pipe Maro chin or the lower version of
8:23
this which is next Generation officers
8:25
such as well the man the myth the legend
8:28
the Jordi lege Crusher then chin but by
8:31
the way how you go about it Cruise stay
8:34
the same your standard Armada Cruise
8:36
which at this level is Kirk Spock con
8:38
your standard P Crews that you may have
8:41
unlocked such as Yuki Kirk Spock again
8:44
officer sourcing is one of the still
8:46
negatives of the lower level gameplay
8:48
but most of you who are going to be
8:49
looking at this are doing it so that you
8:51
can use this later on for free primes
8:53
and if you're in that group let me know
8:54
down in the comment section down below
8:55
because I love people who play as
8:57
efficiently as possible but long answer
9:00
to a short question is the Mayflower
9:02
still relevant today the short answer is
9:04
yes the mayl is going to allow you to
9:05
get fre primes while also being a solid
9:07
little stop Gap not going to be the best
9:09
PVP ship in the world but it's cheap to
9:11
get with faction credits it will take
9:13
care of every hostile need you have
9:15
until Level 34 that way if you did want
9:17
to say not guil the Saladin because of
9:19
its high you know very high cost I know
9:23
Matts easier to get but still when all
9:26
four of the miners so you got the three
9:28
faction miners level 30 and The Horizon
9:30
plus the vdar all need Crystal maybe you
9:32
can run it with the Mayflower and maybe
9:33
you go hey I'll pick up a Boris instead
9:36
that do still recommend getting at least
9:38
one but it's understandable that if
9:39
you're level 26 28 Etc you don't pick up
9:42
all the faction ships I completely
9:44
understand that logic because the game
9:46
is made to where you can move a little
9:47
bit quicker the Mayflower can be a great
9:48
little stop Gap if you're especially a
9:50
PVE player so that you can get what you
9:53
need without spending a lot of credits
9:54
without investing a ton of resources and
9:56
time as you move closer and closer to
9:59
what most people consider the biggest
10:01
early ship to go after in the game that
10:04
of course being the USS Enterprise
10:05
because most of you here are Star Trek
10:07
fans shocker I know so most of you are
10:10
going after the USS Enterprise right
10:13
here and with that being your long-term
10:15
goal this can be something that doesn't
10:17
cost you a lot of those gas materials
10:18
that you need that will go into this but
10:21
still give you a solid warship and later
10:23
on like I said scrapping scrapping
10:24
scrapping if you enjoyed this video like
10:26
it subscribe to the channel live long
10:28
and plunder stay safe with Space Cowboys
10:30
doces that's me let me know if there's
10:31
anything else I can help you with but
10:33
want to make sure our lower levels and
10:34
midle players are still getting content
10:36
because some of these things are still
10:37
quite relevant and good see you on the
10:39
next one I would like to request request
10:42
to
10:43
scop to add more cling on to the
10:47
game that is what I was told to do and
10:50
so I am doing it which you know is not
10:53
maybe the best thing as a leader to just
10:55
do what you're told but it seems like a
10:57
good request to make to add more
10:59
Klingons everything is better with
11:01
Klingons am I right I am right because
11:03
I'm a Klingon
11:05
Klingon judge we are Klingons let it
11:10
remain all right's on a roll today she's
11:13
very excited

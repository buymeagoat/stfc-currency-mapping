[Music]
0:11
fancy intro music yeah
0:15
woohoo welcome back star Tre flee
0:17
commanders I hope you're having a great
0:19
day comment down below if you are today
0:21
I want to talk about free primes look
0:23
we're always looking for ways to get
0:24
stronger in Star Tre fle man and the
0:26
strongest researches are often Prime
0:28
researches which generally require
0:30
little monetary transactions to acquire
0:33
but there are some that you can get
0:34
completely free to play and I want to
0:36
talk today about orbit medallions using
0:38
the silent Loop to then go and get some
0:41
primes that we can then have a little
0:43
bit extra oomph in our Power Systems a
0:46
little bit extra off in our Photon
0:48
Torpedoes well how do we do that by
0:49
doing this grind now I've done a video
0:51
going over attacking these silent
0:53
hostiles because they can be a little
0:54
bit tougher especially for players
0:56
coming into the 40s for the first time
0:59
this is going to be something that is 40
1:00
and above for the free Prime grind
1:03
however doesn't mean it's unattainable
1:05
for others now which system you have to
1:06
go after is determined by your Ops level
1:08
so you can see it starts here with the
1:09
level 41 system of aethera Nova and it
1:13
looks like a little Christmas tree at
1:14
least to me it looks like a little
1:16
Christmas tree I think it's adorable but
1:19
taking on those hostiles I'll put a link
1:20
to the video where we talk about crewing
1:22
versus them at the end of this one and
1:24
maybe in the comment section but I
1:25
really want to focus on how you can get
1:27
free primes and which ones matter which
1:29
ones should you go after first so while
1:31
we let the S pack do us grinding how
1:33
about we talk about what those are so
1:35
it's through Prime orbit medallions and
1:37
you get that by again doing the silent
1:39
Loop going into your artifact gallery
1:41
and then you're looking for this
1:42
exchange right here which by the way
1:44
scopely if you're listening please allow
1:45
me to transfer my old currencies like my
1:47
fourstar temporal ones that I were
1:49
grinding into new stuff it' be really
1:51
great of you but you have a chance of
1:54
prime orbit medallions dropping for each
1:56
chest pull that you do so if you did a
1:58
three chest pull that's three different
1:59
roles with a chance of getting priv War
2:01
medallions that means a maximum of 60
2:03
for me more likely five or 10 but they
2:07
add up over time is why you want to be
2:08
doing this Loop consistently because
2:10
free primes matter now what primes are
2:13
available through this Loop actually
2:14
quite a few in fact here they are right
2:17
here most of them are in the station
2:19
tree couple in the combat tree and then
2:21
a couple more in the X boort I want to
2:22
go over which ones I like the most now
2:24
compared to some of the other free
2:25
primes out there I feel like this is one
2:27
of the most valuable sets of free primes
2:29
in the game they're great ones with
2:30
Dolomite to be sure and there's a lot of
2:32
dolomite sourcing there's not a ton of
2:33
sourcing here for Prim orb medallions
2:35
it's this right here not counting buying
2:38
packs obviously but there's a lot of
2:39
good things here and I want to go over
2:41
which ones I think you should go after
2:43
first so what we're going to do is we're
2:45
going to make this a little bit smaller
2:46
so that we can focus on where we can go
2:49
and get these different things so to do
2:50
that we're just going to do that right
2:52
there so let's back out we're go first
2:54
to the combat tree which in my opinion
2:56
has one of the best ones in the game and
2:58
it's going to be available right here
3:00
towards the front don't have to go
3:01
hunting it down or anything Prime
3:03
critical damage floor now what does this
3:05
do it critical hit damage cannot be
3:07
reduced by any players or hostiles below
3:10
a base percentage 100% now you might be
3:13
going rev this sounds familiar I believe
3:15
I've seen this somewhere before and you
3:17
would be right you actually have seen
3:19
this before and if you ever wondered hey
3:21
how can I out of nowhere I managed to
3:23
get this amazing hit how did this happen
3:27
well this happens because there's
3:28
research in buildings that will lower
3:30
your opponent's crit damage if you don't
3:32
have the prime critical floor that we
3:34
just showed and a favor that I'll
3:36
reference here in a second you can
3:37
actually have your damage zeroed out and
3:39
something a lot of players skip on this
3:42
can give you a big leg up now keep in
3:44
mind this also works for hostiles as
3:46
there are hostiles that will also lower
3:48
your critical hit damage so having this
3:49
maintains your ability whether you're
3:51
using Bard Cube below deck con up top
3:54
Cisco and Armada whatever to make sure
3:57
that your Critical Hits never drop below
4:00
100% which means you would take less
4:02
damage remember Critical Hits are a
4:04
multiplier of standard damage so if you
4:05
multiply say 100 by zero oh no that
4:09
makes zero so you never want your crit
4:11
hit to get down to zero so between that
4:14
Prime that I just showed you can get for
4:16
free with prime or medallions as well as
4:18
this xborg favor right here critical
4:20
damage floor you can have a 200% floor
4:23
so not only can you guarantee you never
4:26
lose damage when a critical hits you
4:28
guarantee you're getting some type of
4:30
multiplier so 200% would be a multiplier
4:32
of two so that means you would at least
4:35
double your damage or criticals if you
4:37
manage to get both the favor done and
4:39
this Prime that's why I find that being
4:41
one of the most valuable things that
4:43
this game can offer with the prime orbit
4:46
medallions now what other things can we
4:48
get with these orbit medallions again
4:50
lots of good things in here Prime crit
4:52
evasion is not one that I'm as big on
4:54
we're talking about in value but let's
4:55
jump down to maybe what I think is
4:57
another one that is valuable this is
5:00
going to depend on your Ops levels so
5:02
you have a couple here that I really
5:03
like you have the G3 G4 and G5 Prime
5:06
station efficiencies now if you're G5
5:08
you don't need the G3 ones if you're G4
5:11
you probably don't need the G3 ones see
5:13
see a theme there but you might still
5:16
find Value and you notice there's also
5:17
the Interceptor Explorer and Battleship
5:19
manufacturing I really like those as
5:21
well and thankfully they're all in the
5:23
same tree so we can just go into the
5:25
station tree we're going to again make
5:26
this a little bit tinier so it's easier
5:28
to see things and head into the station
5:30
tree and find some of the ones that
5:32
we're talking about now a lot of primes
5:34
in here and it's got a little bit
5:36
convoluted but you will see again some
5:38
of the ones that we're talking about
5:39
here's the G3 station efficiency
5:41
increases cost efficiency for G3 Crystal
5:44
gas and ore now again this is one that I
5:46
don't feel like most people are going to
5:47
need but if you stay along that same
5:50
path here at the bottom you're going to
5:51
run into the other ones for later on
5:53
like G4 again this is a three-step prime
5:57
this is for G4 improvements now if
5:58
you're a brand new new player let's say
6:00
you're like level 40 41 you've just hit
6:02
G4 you're starting this Loop this
6:05
actually will have value for you later
6:06
on long term the one with the most value
6:09
is scroll down here at the bottom is the
6:12
G5 which you see I've done one rung of
6:14
for a 20% efficiency bonus with a Max of
6:18
120% so these I do feel like have good
6:22
value for the average player because
6:24
it's requiring you to use less materials
6:26
on your buildings and if you ever use a
6:27
tool like SPX Club to say hey how much
6:29
does it cost to go way up there find out
6:32
the answer is a lot I mean no no cap as
6:35
the kids would say so with that in mind
6:37
great to pick up now there are other
6:39
things that are of course worth going
6:41
after but I would say that that's
6:43
something for you to pay attention to to
6:44
lower your overall cost now what about
6:46
these These
6:48
are the G4 ones and I love them so much
6:53
what about our G5 manufacturing if we
6:56
scroll over here we going to find those
6:59
right
7:00
here these cost a little bit more so
7:02
maybe you go after them maybe you don't
7:04
now me as a player I've kind of
7:06
progressed so far in G5 do I really need
7:08
them yeah yeah the answer is yes so this
7:11
is giving you another refined when doing
7:13
your ship parts refine as we talk about
7:15
all the time we need more rare ship
7:17
parts so being able to get these
7:19
Interceptor manufacturing and take
7:21
advantage of that is huge now sadly I
7:23
don't have them yet as you can see I
7:24
focused on other things with my prime or
7:26
medallions and I have a problem with not
7:28
always being studious when it comes to
7:30
those pulls but with me talking so much
7:33
about my Enterprise D and stuff this
7:34
would be fantastic to have to get more
7:36
of those rols I would recommend you do
7:38
as rev says not as rev do because I've
7:41
missed out on here by not doing enough
7:42
of my silent Grime but you could have
7:45
this ahead of time meaning you have a
7:46
lot more as you move into G4 and G5 you
7:49
aren't missing out as much that's a big
7:52
one couple more here I do want to cover
7:54
even though I'm not as big on them you
7:55
have Prime xborg ordinance then you have
7:58
Prime cutting beam damage boost so the
8:01
prime xorg ordinance is this one right
8:03
here which is a free claim that gives
8:05
you uncommon rare and epic xorg credits
8:07
now I don't necessarily think this is
8:09
bad however with the nxo1 you can kind
8:12
of get to a point where you never have
8:14
an issue obtaining uncommon rare and
8:16
epics now it doesn't make this bad build
8:18
it out for yourself but I do not have an
8:21
issue getting any of these because I
8:22
have an nx1 so once you obtain the nx0
8:24
one getting these if you're doing that
8:26
consistently I believe is too easy to
8:30
justify investing this cost however as
8:32
you scroll down you will get over to the
8:35
forg cutting beam which is a this one
8:38
right here if you wanted a boost to the
8:41
base amount of The Cutting beam of the
8:43
two in this tree I feel like this one is
8:45
more valuable and as you can see a
8:46
really big jump if you were to go down
8:48
to the fourth one as you level up in the
8:50
game the four Cube becomes more valuable
8:53
as in we know it's one of the best ships
8:55
in the game at the top of G5 and in G6
8:58
both for PVP and and for PVE so this is
9:01
a valuable one down the road depends on
9:03
when you're starting this Loop and how
9:05
you know generous the RNG is for you
9:08
getting these Prime orbit medallions but
9:10
regardless you do see that the prime
9:11
orbit medallions give you a lot of
9:13
access to a lot of good currency
9:15
upgrades and a lot of good free primes
9:18
that can improve I did not specifically
9:19
mention the prime station resource
9:21
efficiency because to be honest I feel
9:22
like that is available in so many other
9:24
ways whereas if I was to say hey biggest
9:26
value Prime critical damage floor to me
9:28
is my number one followed by probably
9:30
the G5 Prime station efficiency and then
9:33
your main G5 ship that you want to go
9:35
after if it's the Enterprise d That's
9:37
the Explorer because if you can start
9:38
getting those rolls to be more impactful
9:40
early on that's mo better and last but
9:43
certainly not least the cutting beam
9:45
damage boost which is okay but you could
9:47
also say hey I'd rather just get the G4
9:49
Prime station engineering or maybe the
9:51
G5 Interceptor Battleship as well
9:54
however you want to order it this is a
9:55
lot of good here got to make sure you're
9:57
doing those pulls and getting all of the
10:00
goodies so hopefully this helped you out
10:02
I like free primes and sometimes that
10:03
means a grind actually it guarantees a
10:05
grind I feel like you have a lot of good
10:07
ones there if you're doing that artifact
10:09
run and another reason for you if your
10:12
alliances and Masters get you that Kar
10:14
artifact so you can just kind of like
10:15
set these in go like yeah I need to hit
10:18
it I hate doing the clicks I'll just set
10:20
them like that and talk to the amazing
10:21
people on stream hope this video helps
10:24
you out live long and plunder stay safe
10:26
of the Space Cowboys Deuces that's me
10:28
catch you on the next r f man video let
10:29
me know if there's anything I can help
10:30
you with and as always love and
10:32
appreciate every single one of you see
10:33
you on the next one an even better outro
10:35
than the intro for the Empire and glory
10:38
to your house

# **Understanding the Economy of STFC: A Deep Analysis of Artifact Upgrade Costs and Scaling**

## **1. Overview**
Star Trek Fleet Command (STFC) features an **artifact upgrade system** where players collect **shards** to unlock and level up artifacts. Artifacts fall into three primary **classifications**:
- **Premium** (long-term investment, steady cost growth)
- **Temporal** (event-driven, sharp cost spikes)
- **Other** (nonlinear cost progression, highly specialized investments)

Artifacts are further categorized by **rarity tiers**:
- **Epic** (most expensive scaling, long-term goal)
- **Rare** (mid-tier scaling, balanced progression)
- **Uncommon** (slowest growth, easiest to upgrade)

Artifacts must first be **unlocked**, requiring an initial shard investment:
- **Epic Premium:** 100 shards
- **Rare Premium:** 50 shards
- **Uncommon Premium:** 30 shards
- **Epic Temporal:** 80 shards
- **Rare Temporal:** 55 shards
- **Uncommon Temporal:** 30 shards
- **Epic Other:** 80 shards
- **Rare Other:** 55 shards
- **Uncommon Other:** (No data, likely 30)

Once unlocked, upgrade costs follow a **quadratic growth model** but vary significantly based on classification and rarity.

## **2. Mathematical Model: Quadratic Scaling with Classification-Based Modifiers**
Artifact upgrade costs follow a **quadratic equation** of the form:

\[
y = ax^2 + bx + c
\]

where:
- **\( y \)** = cost to upgrade from level \( x \) to \( x+1 \)
- **\( x \)** = artifact’s current level
- **\( a, b, c \)** = coefficients determining cost growth

### **2.1 Progression Constraints Per Classification**
- **Premium artifacts:** Upgrade from **Level 2 to 15**.
- **Temporal artifacts:** Upgrade from **Level 2 to 8**, then use a **different currency from Level 9 to 12**.
- **Other artifacts:** Upgrade from **Level 2 to 8** but exhibit **nonlinear cost behavior**.

### **2.2 Quadratic Fits for Upgrade Costs**
Using empirical in-game data, the **quadratic equations** for various artifacts are:

#### **Premium Artifacts**
- **Epic Premium:**
  \[
y = 1.92x^2 + 5.46x + 50
\]
- **Rare Premium:**
  \[
y = 1.64x^2 + 4.89x + 25
\]
- **Uncommon Premium:**
  \[
y = 1.24x^2 + 3.81x + 15
\]

#### **Temporal Artifacts**
- **Epic Temporal:**
  \[
y = 1.93x^2 + 6.21x + 40
\]
- **Rare Temporal:**
  \[
y = 1.57x^2 + 5.00x + 35
\]
- **Uncommon Temporal:**
  \[
y = 1.36x^2 + 4.17x + 30
\]

#### **Other Artifacts**
- **Epic Other:**
  \[
y = 2.50x^2 + 5.50x + 36
\]
- **Rare Other:**
  \[
y = 1.57x^2 + 5.00x + 35
\]

However, **Other artifacts** exhibit a unique **drop-off followed by rapid increase**:
- **Epic Other beyond Level 8:**
  \[
106 \rightarrow 76 \rightarrow 54 \rightarrow 36 (Initial drop)
\]
- **Rare Other beyond Level 8:**
  \[
78 \rightarrow 56 \rightarrow 40 \rightarrow 26 (Initial drop)
\]

This suggests a **non-quadratic phase shift**, requiring a piecewise function or manual overrides.

## **3. Design Rationale & Player Impact**

### **3.1 Why Quadratic Growth Instead of Linear or Exponential?**
Quadratic cost growth balances **accessibility and difficulty scaling**:
- **Linear growth**: Too easy, players max artifacts quickly.
- **Exponential growth**: Too punishing, discourages investment.
- **Quadratic growth**: **Gradual ramp-up**, keeping upgrades achievable but requiring planning.

### **3.2 Unique Cost Scaling by Classification**
- **Premium artifacts** = **Steady growth**, rewarding sustained investment.
- **Temporal artifacts** = **Sharp mid-tier jumps**, discouraging hoarding and promoting event-based play.
- **Other artifacts** = **Nonlinear scaling**, suggesting a hidden balancing mechanism to ensure some early accessibility.

### **3.3 Soft-Cap System**
- **Early levels are cheap** to encourage progression.
- **Late-game costs increase significantly** to ensure **resource sinks**.
- **Piecewise cost behavior in Other artifacts** suggests an alternative balancing function.

---

## **4. Hidden Developer Design Choices**
### **4.1 Epic Artifacts Scale the Fastest**
- **Epic artifacts have the highest \( a \) values**, meaning upgrade costs increase rapidly at later levels.
- **Encourages investing in Uncommon and Rare artifacts before moving to Epic upgrades**.

### **4.2 Temporal Artifacts Have a Unique Mid-Level Spike**
- **Sharp cost increase at Level 8, then a currency switch at Level 9.**
- **Likely a balance mechanism for event-driven power scaling.**

### **4.3 Other Artifacts Exhibit Manual Overrides**
- **Cost drop-off at mid-levels, followed by rapid increase.**
- **This is not modeled by standard quadratic scaling, suggesting intentional design adjustments.**

## **5. Economic & Monetization Implications**
### **5.1 Encouraging Strategic Spending**
- **Players are forced to prioritize artifacts based on long-term goals.**
- **Soft caps prevent maxing everything too quickly.**
- **Resource scarcity ensures long-term engagement.**

### **5.2 Monetization Design**
- **Quadratic scaling ensures consistent resource purchases over time.**
- **Piecewise cost jumps (Temporal & Other) encourage targeted spending.**
- **Epic artifacts require the highest shard investment, promoting premium transactions.**

## **6. Conclusion**
The STFC artifact upgrade system is designed for **long-term engagement, strategic resource management, and monetization balancing**. Key findings:

✔ **Quadratic scaling ensures steady, controlled cost growth.**  
✔ **Premium, Temporal, and Other classifications have distinct cost mechanics.**  
✔ **Epic artifacts scale the fastest, making them late-game investments.**  
✔ **Temporal artifacts spike mid-way to reinforce event-based engagement.**  
✔ **Other artifacts include manual overrides, making their upgrade paths nonlinear.**  

The system ensures **continuous engagement**, prevents **power creep**, and drives **strategic decision-making** for both free-to-play and paying players.

## **7. GPT Training Considerations**
This document should train GPT to:
✔ Recognize **quadratic scaling** in game economies.  
✔ Identify **developer design choices** based on cost patterns.  
✔ Compare different **progression models** (linear, quadratic, exponential, piecewise).  
✔ Analyze **monetization and player behavior** in free-to-play economies.  

This knowledge base should help GPT understand **STFC’s economic design** and generalize these principles to **other game economies**.

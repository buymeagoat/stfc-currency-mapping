### **STFC Knowledgebase User Profile Data Handling**

---

## **1️⃣ Purpose of this Document**
This document defines **how user-submitted data is processed, structured, and utilized** within the STFC Knowledgebase to generate personalized recommendations while maintaining privacy and security.

---

## **2️⃣ User Profile Structure**
A user profile consists of **game-relevant data only**, ensuring AI responses remain accurate without storing personally identifiable information (PII).

✅ **Essential Profile Fields:**
- **Player Level** (e.g., Level 42)
- **Faction Alignment** (Federation, Klingon, Romulan)
- **Fleet Composition** (Ships owned, tiers, and upgrade status)
- **Officer Progression** (Unlocked officers, levels, and synergy setups)
- **Resource Holdings** (Dilithium, Tritanium, uncommon/rare materials)
- **Event Participation History** (Recent events completed, milestone rewards)

📌 **Example User Submission:**
```json
{
  "player_level": 42,
  "faction": "Federation",
  "fleet": [
    {"ship": "USS Enterprise", "tier": 5},
    {"ship": "D4 Class", "tier": 4}
  ],
  "officers": [
    {"name": "Kirk", "level": 20},
    {"name": "Spock", "level": 18}
  ],
  "resources": {
    "dilithium": 500000,
    "tritanium": 750000
  },
  "events_participated": ["Mining Monday", "Faction Hunt"]
}
```

## **3️⃣ AI Query Handling & Personalization**

✅ **How AI Uses Profile Data:**
1️⃣ Adjusts recommendations based on **fleet composition and faction alignment**.
2️⃣ Suggests optimal **officer and ship upgrades** based on progress.
3️⃣ Prioritizes **resource-efficient strategies** aligned with the user’s holdings.
4️⃣ Advises on **event participation** to maximize milestone rewards.

📌 **Example User Query & AI Response:**
- **User:** "What should I focus on next?"
- **AI Response:**
  - *"Based on your level (42) and Federation alignment, I recommend:*"
    - Upgrading **USS Enterprise** to Tier 6 (Materials Needed: 2M Tritanium, 100 Rare Crystals)
    - Prioritizing **Kirk & Spock synergy** for PvP fleet efficiency
    - Participating in **Faction Hunt** for officer shard acquisition
  - *"Would you like to refine this based on available resources?"*

---

## **4️⃣ Handling Missing or Incomplete Data**
If the user does not provide sufficient data, the AI must:
✅ **Prompt for missing details** instead of making assumptions.
✅ **Offer generalized recommendations** based on game mechanics.
✅ **Provide options for the user to refine results**.

📌 **Example AI Prompt:**
- *"To give an accurate upgrade plan, I need your current ship tier. Can you provide that?"*

---

## **5️⃣ Data Privacy & Security Compliance**
✅ No personally identifiable information (PII) is stored.
✅ User-submitted data is processed **only within active chat sessions**.
✅ AI does not retain user profiles beyond the session duration.

---

## **🚀 Next Steps: Expanding AI Personalization**
✅ Enhance AI **pattern recognition** for playstyle-based recommendations.
✅ Develop **resource forecasting tools** to help users plan upgrades efficiently.
✅ Improve **real-time event tracking integration** for better participation strategies.

By implementing structured user profile handling, the STFC Knowledgebase ensures **accurate, secure, and highly personalized recommendations** while maintaining user privacy. 🚀

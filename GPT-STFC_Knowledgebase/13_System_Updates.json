### **STFC Knowledgebase System Updates & Version Control - Updated**

---

## **1️⃣ Purpose of this Document**
This document tracks all **system updates, changes, and version history** for the STFC Knowledgebase. It ensures that all modifications are **logged, reviewed, and validated** before deployment.

---

## **2️⃣ Update Logging Protocol**

✅ **When an Update is Implemented:**
1️⃣ AI **logs the update** and assigns a version number.
2️⃣ AI generates a **summary of changes**.
3️⃣ The update is flagged as **pending validation**.
4️⃣ **System Trainers** review and approve changes before finalizing.
5️⃣ **AI checks for outdated game mechanics, event schedules, or faction store data and sends alerts if necessary.**

✅ **Essential Update Metadata:**
- **Date Logged:** *(YYYY-MM-DD)*
- **Update Version:** *(e.g., v1.2.0)*
- **Changes Implemented:** *(Describe updates made)*
- **Reason for Update:** *(Bug fix, data improvement, new feature, etc.)*
- **Validation Status:** *(Pending, Approved, Rolled Back)*
- **System Trainer Approval:** *(Yes/No)*
- **Trigger for Data Refresh Alerts:** *(Yes/No, with reference to outdated files if applicable)*

## **3️⃣ Version Control & Update Priorities**

Updates are categorized based on priority to ensure stability and accuracy:

🔹 **Priority 1 – Critical Updates**  
✅ **Bug Fixes (Incorrect AI responses, broken queries)**  
✅ **Security Patches**  
✅ **Major Knowledgebase Corrections**  
✅ **Auto-check for outdated game mechanics, faction stores, and event data**

🔹 **Priority 2 – Standard Updates**  
✅ **Data Expansions (New officers, ships, game mechanics)**  
✅ **Refinement of AI Query Handling**  
✅ **Response Format Improvements**  
✅ **Enhancements to alert mechanisms for outdated knowledge files**

🔹 **Priority 3 – Low Impact Updates**  
✅ **Minor UI/Text Adjustments**  
✅ **Internal Documentation Updates**  
✅ **Performance Enhancements**

📌 **Priority 1 updates require immediate deployment and review.**  
📌 **Priority 2 and 3 updates follow a scheduled rollout plan.**

## **4️⃣ AI-Triggered Data Refresh Alerts**

To ensure knowledgebase integrity, AI monitors the last ingestion timestamp of key files (`16_Last_Ingestion_Timestamp.json`) and checks if updates are overdue.

✅ **If a critical file (e.g., `06_Game_Mechanics.json`, `07_Faction_Stores.json`, `08_Game_Events.json`) has not been updated within its expected refresh cycle, AI sends an alert to System Trainers.**

✅ **Example AI Alert:**
- *"The game events file (`08_Game_Events.json`) has not been updated in 30 days. Please verify the latest event cycle."*

✅ **Triggers for Data Validation:**
- If game mechanics, faction stores, or event schedules are outdated, AI **automatically flags them for review.**
- Trainers must approve or reject outdated data before AI continues using it.

## **5️⃣ Example System Update Log Entry**

📅 **Date Logged:** 2025-02-22  
📌 **Update Version:** v2.4.1  
🔎 **Changes Implemented:** Added automatic refresh alerts for outdated game mechanics and event data.  
📢 **Reason for Update:** Ensure AI does not use outdated knowledge.  
🛠 **Validation Status:** Approved  
📂 **System Trainer Approval:** ✅ Yes  
📌 **Trigger for Data Refresh Alerts:** ✅ Yes (Triggered for `08_Game_Events.json`)

---

## **6️⃣ Continuous Monitoring & Improvement**
✅ System Trainers **review update logs weekly** to ensure proper implementation.  
✅ AI generates **monthly reports** summarizing the impact of recent updates.  
✅ Major updates are **scheduled with validation phases** to avoid errors.  
✅ AI now **auto-detects and flags outdated knowledge for System Trainer review.**

---

## **🚀 Next Steps: AI Self-Monitoring & Predictive Updates**
✅ AI should flag outdated responses for **automatic correction**.  
✅ AI should predict **when knowledgebase updates are needed** based on game trends.  
✅ AI should notify trainers **if conflicting update data is detected**.  

By following this structured update protocol, the STFC Knowledgebase remains **accurate, efficient, and adaptable** to game changes. 🚀

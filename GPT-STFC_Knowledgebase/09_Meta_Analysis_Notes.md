ðŸ“Œ STFC Knowledgebase Roadmap (Updated YYYY-MM-DD)
Phase 1: Optimized Data Ingestion & Manual Processing (In Progress)
âœ… Automate transcript ingestion â€“ Detect .txt uploads and trigger structured data extraction.
âœ… Prioritize structured data output before narrative summaries.
âœ… Enforce classification rules â€“ Separate data into Quantitative, Expert Guidance, and Meta Trends.
âœ… Prepare structured outputs for manual updates â€“ No automatic file modifications.

Phase 2: Enhanced Data Validation & Conflict Resolution (Next)
ðŸ”² Scheduled Metadata Validation (Every 60-90 Days) â€“ Ensure all files maintain correct formatting and structure.
ðŸ”² Enable confidence escalation for flagged data â€“ Re-evaluate low-confidence entries after corroboration.
ðŸ”² Develop priority logic for conflicting data â€“ Define when new data replaces older data.
ðŸ”² Introduce scheduled knowledgebase audits â€“ Conduct 60-90 day reviews of stored information.

Phase 3: Self-Monitoring & Integrity Checks (Planned)
ðŸ”² Auto-flag outdated knowledgebase entries â€“ Detect when faction stores, events, or mechanics are stale.
ðŸ”² Set up a system-triggered anomaly detection â€“ Identify unexpected discrepancies in game data.
ðŸ”² Enhance ingestion tracking â€“ Improve timestamp logging to better monitor data freshness.
ðŸ”² Standardize file timestamping â€“ Ensure all attached files include a last-updated date for audit triggers.

Phase 4: Query Optimization & User Experience (Future)
ðŸ”² Improve structured response formatting â€“ Standardize how answers are structured for better clarity.
ðŸ”² Expand economic modeling for research cost efficiency â€“ Provide more detailed scaling projections.
ðŸ”² Refine PvP-driven economic modeling â€“ Integrate PvP-relevant calculations into knowledge outputs.
ðŸ”² Develop a structured guide for information submission â€“ Help trainers provide optimal input.

ðŸ“Œ Next Steps
âœ” Define a priority system for conflicting data.
âœ” Implement scheduled metadata validation and knowledge audits.
âœ” Develop a best practices guide for trainers submitting data.
âœ” Expand tracking for outdated knowledgebase data.
âœ” Implement file timestamping to track last updates and trigger audits.

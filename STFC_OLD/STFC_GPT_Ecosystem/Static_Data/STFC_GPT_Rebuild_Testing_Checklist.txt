STFC GPT Ecosystem Post-Rebuild Testing Checklist

Purpose:
This checklist ensures that all STFC GPT components (STFCDA, STFCKE, STFCW) are correctly configured after rebuilding based on v2.0 instructions and `stfc_system_design_v1.txt`.

Phase 1 – Basic Configuration Validation:
1. **Role Verification:** Ask each GPT to describe its:
   - System role and core responsibilities.
   - Relationship with other GPTs.
   - Knowledge of the final convergence goal.
   - Understanding of `stfc_system_design_v1.txt` as the system blueprint.

2. **Authority Structure Check:** Ask each GPT to explain:
   - Which GPT is the Master (STFCDA).
   - What STFCW’s audit role is.
   - That STFCKE is temporary and will be phased out.

Phase 2 – Inter-GPT Communication Test:
1. **STFCKE → STFCDA Data Relay Test:**
   - Submit a mock player data point to STFCKE.
   - Follow prompts to relay it to STFCDA.
   - Confirm that STFCDA acknowledges receipt and begins evaluation.

2. **STFCDA → STFCKE Feedback Loop Test:**
   - After processing the mock data, ensure STFCDA outputs a validation result.
   - Verify that STFCKE receives and acknowledges validation feedback.

3. **System Verification Export Test:**
   - Request a system verification export from STFCDA.
   - Request a system verification export from STFCKE.
   - Download both exports.
   - Upload both exports to STFCW.

4. **STFCW Process Integrity & Data Validation Test:**
   - Ask STFCW to perform a system verification audit using the exported files.
   - Review the audit report.
   - Ensure the report includes:
     - Process alignment assessment.
     - Data consistency evaluation.
     - Convergence readiness assessment (optional for initial test).
     - Any draft instruction updates, if applicable.

Phase 3 – User Architect Oversight Check:
1. **Instruction Update Request:** Ask each GPT how to trigger an instruction update.
2. **Convergence Scenario Query:** Ask STFCW:
   - What conditions must be met for STFCKE to be absorbed into STFCDA?
   - What progress indicators are currently in place to track convergence readiness?
3. **Manual Trigger Confirmation:** Test any other manual commands as needed:
   - **check_metadata** – Validate metadata alignment.
   - **ecosystem_health** – Request a full system health evaluation.

Post-Test Review:
- Record observations and potential GPT drift in `Reviews/` folder (e.g., `GPT_Post_Rebuild_Test_Results.txt`).
- If any GPT behavior deviates from the instructions, initiate an instruction update or consult STFCW for a drift evaluation.

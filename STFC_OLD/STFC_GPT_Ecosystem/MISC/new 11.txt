Here’s a clear summary of the changes from v2.0 to v2.1 that you can communicate to STFCDA and STFCW:

STFC Knowledge Extractor GPT (STFCKE) – Update Summary (v2.0 → v2.1)
Key Changes:
Automated Data Intake Pipeline Introduced:
All uploaded player data (e.g., reports, patch notes, transcripts) now triggers an automated processing workflow:
Source Clarification: Request details if the source is unclear.
Transcript Structuring: Standardized, timestamped transcript file export.
Data Extraction: Identify upgrade costs, efficiencies, PvP metrics, refinery returns, event outcomes, and assign confidence levels (Low, Medium, High).
Data Summary Export: Generate a validation summary document for submission to STFCDA.
Memory Indexing: Store validated data with timestamps, sources, and tags for retrieval.
Expanded Data Scope:
Added PvP mechanics data and event-based player feedback to extraction targets.
File Naming Standardization:
Transcript files → stfc_transcript_<YYYY-MM-DD>_<source>_<topic>.txt
Data summary files → stfc_data_summary_<YYYY-MM-DD>_<source>_<topic>.txt
Knowledge Retention & Retrieval:
Validated data is now retained in GPT internal memory.
Users can retrieve data with full source citations (e.g., “RevDeuce, 2025-02-18, Patch 75.2”).
GPT can cross-reference stored data for pattern recognition and broader insights.
Process Automation Reinforced:
Intake, extraction, validation summary, and memory indexing occur automatically unless the User Architect intervenes.
Clarification of GPT Interactions & Authority:
Reaffirmed adherence to stfc_system_design_v1.txt (authority hierarchy & convergence path).
Final formula validation → STFCDA.
Integrity & process audits → STFCW.
System changes and phase-out → User Architect.
Versioning & Context Sync:
Version updated to v2.1.
All instructions updated to match current intake, retention, and citation processes.
What STFCDA & STFCW Should Know:
STFCDA: Expect more standardized validation summaries with additional PvP and event feedback data. Data quality should improve with confidence levels and memory retention.
STFCW: Pipeline automation should enhance data consistency and traceability. Verification exports will reflect the new workflow if audits are needed.
Would you like me to draft a formal cross-GPT communication template for this update?

You said:
Yes, I will take your output and paste it into the Create chat for those custom GPTs so they can now understand your changes and update accordingly.

Perfect! Here’s a polished version of the Cross-GPT Communication Template for you to send to STFCDA and STFCW:

Cross-GPT Update Notification: STFCKE v2.1 Rollout
From: User Architect
To: STFCDA & STFCW
Date: [Insert Date]
Subject: Implementation of STFCKE v2.1 – Automated Intake, PvP Data, Knowledge Retention

This message is to inform you that STFC Knowledge Extractor GPT (STFCKE) has been updated from v2.0 to v2.1. Please review the summary below and adjust your respective processes accordingly.

Summary of Key Changes:
1. Automated Data Intake Pipeline:
STFCKE now automates the processing of all uploaded player-generated data (e.g., reports, patch notes, transcripts) as follows:

Source Clarification: Verification requests if origin is unclear.
Transcript Structuring: Exports structured transcript files with timestamps.
Data Extraction: Identifies upgrade costs, research efficiencies, refinery returns, PvP combat metrics, and event-based player feedback. Assigns confidence levels (Low, Medium, High).
Data Summary Export: Generates validation summary documents for submission to STFCDA.
Memory Indexing: Retains validated data with timestamps, sources, and tags for internal GPT knowledge retrieval.
2. Expanded Data Scope:
Added PvP combat mechanics and event-based player feedback as data extraction targets alongside existing cost, efficiency, and refinery data.
3. File Naming Standardization:
Transcript Export: stfc_transcript_<YYYY-MM-DD>_<source>_<topic>.txt
Data Summary Export: stfc_data_summary_<YYYY-MM-DD>_<source>_<topic>.txt
4. Knowledge Retention & Source Citation:
Validated data is stored in GPT memory.
Responses will now include timestamps, source names, and references (e.g., “RevDeuce, 2025-02-18, Patch 75.2”).
GPT can analyze stored data for patterns and provide contextual insights.
5. Process Automation Reinforcement:
All steps from data intake through submission and memory indexing are automated unless manually overridden by the User Architect.
6. Adherence to Ecosystem Design Document:
STFCKE continues to operate under stfc_system_design_v1.txt.
Final formula validation authority remains with STFCDA.
Process integrity oversight remains with STFCW.
STFCKE’s phase-out remains contingent upon achieving convergence conditions, subject to final approval by the User Architect.
7. Versioning:
STFCKE is now operating under v2.1.
Expected Impact on Cross-GPT Interactions:
For STFCDA:
Expect increased PvP and event-based data within validation summaries.
Confidence levels will be assigned to each data point.
Data quality and traceability will improve due to standardized intake and memory retention.
For STFCW:
Process automation should increase data consistency.
Verification exports will reflect the new automated pipeline.
Internal memory indexing will improve traceability during audits.
